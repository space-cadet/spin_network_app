    - Fixed `fs.readFile` signature error in `downloadFile` function.
    - Removed whitespace between `<tbody>` and `{files.map(...)}` to resolve DOM nesting warning.

Implemented the sortable table view UI for the file list in the Log Explorer. This includes the table structure, clickable headers with sort indicators, integration with Redux for sort state management, and fixes for related TypeScript errors and a console warning.


#### [14:26] - T24: Enhance Log Explorer with State Persistence and Sorting (Partial Implementation)

- Modified `/src/components/logs/explorer/FileExplorer.tsx`:
    - Added Redux imports (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`, actions, types).
    - Replaced `useState` for `currentPath`, `selectedFile`, `splitPosition` with `useSelector`.

2. Enhanced file display with detailed information and sorting capabilities

The implementation plan outlines a comprehensive approach for adding these features, including Redux state management, sorting functionality, and UI enhancements. This builds upon the existing log explorer implementation (T22) to create a more robust and user-friendly file management experience.

#### [11:45] - T23: Implement Separate Simulation Controls with Correct Pause/Resume Behavior

Fixed the simulation controls to properly handle the different states of the simulation lifecycle. Separated the combined Play/Pause button into distinct buttons based on context. Added a dedicated Stop button that finalizes the current simulation so that when Play is pressed again, a new simulation is started. Modified the resume functionality to continue from the paused state without resetting the time or creating a new session. These changes ensure that unpausing resumes the simulation from where it was paused and uses the same log session.

- Updated `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/memory-bank/edit_history.md` - Documented the bug fix

Fixed a critical bug in the intertwiner dimension calculation that was incorrectly determining allowed intermediate spins when coupling angular momenta. The issue was in the `allowed_intermediate_spins()` function which wasn't properly enforcing quantum mechanical selection rules. The fix correctly applies the rule that when coupling integer and half-integer spins, the resulting intermediate spins must follow specific patterns, ensuring that physical constraints of angular momentum coupling are preserved. This corrects the calculation for `intertwiner_dimension(1, 0.5, 0.5, 1)` which now properly returns 2 instead of 3.

The main problem was that BrowserFS is a virtual file system that can't handle absolute paths like `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/logs`. Changed all paths to be relative (e.g., `/logs`) and improved the directory creation logic to create directories in the correct hierarchical order. Added comprehensive error handling and improved logging for easier debugging. Also documented considerations for implementing a file viewer to browse the BrowserFS virtual file system.

#### 19:30 - T17: Fix TypeScript Build Errors

- Added missing `getGraph()` method to `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/simulation/core/engineImplementation.ts` - Fixed errors related to getGraph method access
- Modified `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts` - Added index signatures to geometric and statistics objects for type-safe dynamic property access
- Modified `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts` - Fixed SimulationParameters type compatibility issues with proper conversion
- Modified `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/components/simulation/SimulationResultsPanel.tsx` - Fixed boolean conversion for fromLogs variable

The most critical fix was adding the missing `getGraph()` method to the `SpinNetworkSimulationEngineImpl` class, which was being referenced in multiple places but didn't exist. Also addressed issues with object index signatures to enable type-safe dynamic property access, fixed boolean conversion, and resolved void vs number type comparisons in database operations. These changes improve the type safety of the application but some TypeScript errors still remain to be addressed in a future session.

Fixed the issue with missing geometric variables (totalVolume, totalArea, effectiveDimension, volumeEntropy) in CSV exports. The CSV export now properly includes all metrics with consistent column headers. The export button functionality was also enhanced to produce both JSON (for configuration and parameters) and CSV (for time-series results data) files simultaneously. There remains an unresolved issue with session persistence between page reloads that will need further investigation.

Implemented UI improvements to enhance the usability of the spin network application. Fixed the zoom controls to remain visible when scrolling the network visualization panel by implementing a dedicated scrollable container with fixed controls. Completely redesigned the network creation interface by replacing the tab structure with a unified, streamlined approach that uses a single network name field and visual type selector. Added conditional parameter display based on the selected network type. Updated model types and generator functions to properly support custom network naming.

#### 14:30 - T14: State Management Architecture for Standalone Library
- Modified `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/memory-bank/implementation-details/standalone-lib/standalone-architecture.md` - Updated with event system and adapter layers

Modified the enhancement plan to prioritize framework independence through state management adapters. Created a reference implementation for the event system, framework adapters, and persistence layer that will serve as a guide for actual implementation.

#### 14:30 - TypeScript Error Fixes for Build Process

- Modified `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/lib/utils/simulationLogger.ts` - Fixed TypeScript error for LogCategory reference by adding type checking and changing the output format to handle both string and enum types
- Modified `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/lib/utils/simulationLogger.ts` - Added null checks for `window.fs` to fix 'possibly undefined' TypeScript errors in multiple locations

These changes address TypeScript errors that were preventing the successful build of the application. The modifications primarily focused on proper type checking and null reference prevention in the simulation logger module.

- Updated `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/memory-bank/session_cache.md` - Added T12 context and implementation details

Fixed numerical instability issues in the standalone simulation by implementing:
1. A comprehensive stability monitoring system using the new simulationLogger.ts utility
2. State normalization to prevent exponential growth of state values
3. Graph configuration options for different network topologies (line, ring, grid, random)
4. Continue/pause functionality with proper button state management
5. Selection controls for diffusion models, numerical solvers, and simulation parameters

The changes significantly improve the stability and usability of the standalone simulation test page.

- Updated `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/memory-bank/edit_history.md` - Added entry for simulation and build fixes

Fixed two critical issues with the library build and simulation execution:
1. Fixed build error by properly exporting ConservationLawChecker as a type using `export type { ConservationLawChecker }` in analysis/index.ts.
2. Fixed simulation not actually running by adding `simulationEngine.runSteps(5)` to the animation loop in standalone-test.js.
3. Added proper completion handling to avoid infinite logging loops after simulation completion.
