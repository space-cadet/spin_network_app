  - Converted CommonJS `require` statements to ES module `import` statements
  - Changed `module.exports` to individual `export` declarations
  - Updated file to use proper ES module syntax throughout
  - Fixed dependency imports for intertwinerSpace functions

- Modified `/lib-bundle.config.js`:
  - Updated output directory path to write directly to public/dist/lib
  - Fixed build configuration to properly handle ES modules
  - Removed problematic path resolution that caused recursive errors

- Modified `/public/tensor-sandbox.html`:
  - Fixed script loading order and dependencies
  - Updated to use UMD library directly instead of adapter
  - Improved error handling for script loading failures

- Modified `/public/scripts/tensor-sandbox.js`:
  - Updated to use UMD library functions directly
  - Removed unnecessary adapter layer references
  - Fixed tensor node creation implementation

- Removed `/public/scripts/tensor-bridge.js`:
  - Eliminated unnecessary adapter layer
  - Functionality now provided directly by UMD library

Successfully fixed browser compatibility issues in the tensor module by converting Node.js-style CommonJS code to ES modules, properly configuring the UMD build, and simplifying the architecture by removing the unnecessary adapter layer. The changes allow the tensor sandbox to work correctly with proper function access through the UMD bundle.

### April 23, 2025

#### [15:30] - T38: Remove Unnecessary Adapter Layer for Tensor Functions

- Modified `/public/tensor-sandbox.html` - Removed reference to spin-network-adapter.js and simplified loading model
- Removed `/public/scripts/spin-network-adapter.js` - Eliminated unnecessary adapter layer
- Modified `/public/scripts/tensor-sandbox.js` - Updated to use UMD library functions directly

Simplified the tensor sandbox implementation by removing the unnecessary adapter layer that was causing errors. The spin-network-adapter.js file was introducing complexity by attempting to wrap the library functions in another layer, which led to "function not found" errors. By eliminating this adapter and having the tensor-sandbox.js use the UMD library directly, we've simplified the architecture and fixed the errors with creating tensor nodes and state vector edges.

#### [14:30] - T38: Implement Intertwiner Tensor Initialization

- Created `/lib/tensor/tensorNode.js` - Core implementation for tensor node initialization with intertwiner elements
- Created `/lib/tensor/index.ts` - Export for enhanced tensor functionality
- Modified `/lib/index.ts` - Added exports for tensor module's enhanced functionality
- Modified `/lib/core/tensor.ts` - Fixed syntax error in try-catch block causing build failure
- Modified `/public/scripts/spin-network-adapter.js` - Updated to use enhanced tensor functionality
- Modified `/public/scripts/tensor-sandbox.js` - Improved network creation with tensor dimensions based on edge spins

Added functionality to properly initialize tensor nodes with appropriate intertwiner tensor elements based on edge spins. Fixed a critical issue where tensor nodes were created with empty elements arrays, preventing proper display of non-trivial intertwiner components for 3-valent and 4-valent nodes. Connected the existing intertwiner space calculations from `intertwinerSpace.ts` with the tensor node creation process to ensure proper initialization of tensor elements.

### April 22, 2025

#### [15:45] - T36: Fix Tensor Sandbox and Add Lattice Network Option

- Modified `/public/tensor-sandbox.html` - Added missing script tag to load tensor-bridge.js
- Modified `/public/scripts/tensor-sandbox.js` - Added "Lattice Network" option to network type dropdown

- Modified `/public/scripts/tensor-bridge.js` - Enhanced tensor-bridge.js compatibility with library functions
- Modified `/memory-bank/errorLog.md` - Added error report and fix for tensor-sandbox issue
- Modified `/memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated task T36 with completed criteria and progress

Fixed a critical error in the tensor sandbox where the tensor-bridge.js file wasn't being loaded, causing "createTensorNode is not a function" errors. Added a new Lattice Network option to create nodes with higher valence (4-valent with dimensions [2, 2, 2, 2]), enabling non-zero intertwiner tensor components. This is crucial for testing the tensor operations with realistic intertwiner spaces.

The T34 task now specifically focuses on the React integration and duplication removal aspects, while T1 focuses on the core library implementation and T14 on the event system within the library.

### April 21, 2025

#### [18:08] - T33: Fix Script Path for UMD Library in Standalone Guide

- Modified `/public/docs/implementation/standalone-guide.html`:
  - Updated UMD library script path from `/dist/lib/spin-network.umd.js` to `../../dist/lib/spin-network.umd.js`
  - Fixed script loading issues by using relative path instead of absolute path
  - This resolves one of the key issues identified in task T33 related to script loading failures

This change fixes one of the main issues with the documentation system by using the correct relative path to load the UMD library in the standalone guide. The previous absolute path was causing script loading failures in both development and production environments.

#### [14:42] - T33: Enhance DocsViewer for Improved Document Loading and HTML Processing

- Modified `/src/components/documentation/DocsViewer.tsx`:

  - Added detailed completion criteria for all aspects of the documentation issues
  - Added list of relevant files that need modification

- Updated `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/memory-bank/session_cache.md`:
  - Updated task focus to T33
  - Added detailed context for T33 with implementation plan
  - Updated status of T28 to complete
  - Updated task registry to include T33

This update creates a new task to address the four main issues that were found after standardizing the documentation structure:
1. In markdown files, section titles are displayed with ID anchors showing literally (e.g., "Core Concepts {#core-concepts}")
2. The standalone-guide.html interactive buttons don't function due to script loading failures
3. The simulation-test.html shows missing simulation files error despite running the build command
4. Page reloads cause navigation issues where content disappears and can't be restored with back button

### April 20, 2025

#### [22:30] - T32: Fix Library Build Errors

- Modified `/lib/core/index.ts`:
  - Fixed interface export by using explicit `export type` syntax for `IntertwinerBasisState`
  - Separated type exports from value exports to resolve bundling issues
  - Changed from:
    ```typescript
    export {
      triangleInequality,
      allowedIntermediateSpins,
      intertwinerDimension,
      getIntertwinerBasis,
      getOptimizedIntertwinerBasis,
      IntertwinerBasisState
    } from './intertwinerSpace';
    ```
  - To:
    ```typescript
    export {
      triangleInequality,
      allowedIntermediateSpins,
      intertwinerDimension,
      getIntertwinerBasis,
      getOptimizedIntertwinerBasis,
    } from './intertwinerSpace';
    export type { IntertwinerBasisState } from './intertwinerSpace';
    ```
- Updated `/memory-bank/errorLog.md`:
  - Added detailed error log entry for the TypeScript build error with cause and solution
- Updated `/memory-bank/tasks.md`:
  - Added task T32 for fixing library build errors
  - Updated task list with completion status
  - Added detailed task implementation notes

Fixed the TypeScript build error that was preventing the library from building successfully. The issue was related to how TypeScript/Vite handles interface exports during bundling. By explicitly separating the interface export with `export type`, the build process now correctly handles the type exports, allowing the library to build successfully. This approach provides clearer instructions to the TypeScript compiler and bundler about how to handle interfaces during the build process.

### April 20, 2025

#### [21:45] - T28: Fix Documentation Path Issues

  - Added more robust checks before calling engine methods
- Updated `/memory-bank/tasks.md`:
  - Created task T28 for fixing documentation path issues
  - Updated task completion criteria and implementation details

These changes fix the documentation page loading issues by implementing a more robust path resolution system that can handle both local development and production environments. The fallback mechanism tries multiple possible paths for each resource, ensuring that files can be found regardless of their exact location. The UMD library loading has been improved with dynamic script loading and fallbacks to various paths. Additionally, the library build errors have been fixed by properly implementing the SimulationStateVector class and fixing import issues.

### April 20, 2025

#### [20:00] - Task Status Updates

- Modified `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/memory-bank/tasks.md`:
  - Updated task T26 (Fix BrowserFS in Vercel Deployment) to COMPLETE
  - Updated task T27 (Fix Node/Edge Property Updates) to COMPLETE
  - Updated task T18 (Fix Logging File Paths and Structure) to COMPLETE
  - Updated task T19 (Implement BrowserFS File Viewer) to COMPLETE
  - Updated task T24 (Enhance Log Explorer with State Persistence and Sorting) to COMPLETE
  - Updated "Completed Tasks" section to include all newly completed tasks
  - Updated task completion criteria to reflect verified changes

Updated task status based on verified implementation and completion criteria. All the mentioned tasks have been successfully implemented and verified. The BrowserFS fix has been confirmed to work in Vercel deployment, node/edge property updates now work correctly without requiring page refreshes, and the log explorer enhancements have been completed with state persistence.

### April 20, 2025

#### [16:30] - T27: Fix Node/Edge Property Updates

- Modified `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/components/workspace/CytoscapeManager/hooks/useCytoscapeInstance.ts`:
  - Added new useEffect hook to update Cytoscape styles when they change
  - Added styles to dependency array to ensure updates trigger the effect
  - Implemented direct style application via cy.style(styles) within the effect

Fixed issue where changes to node and edge properties required a page refresh before they were applied to the visualization. The root cause was that the Cytoscape instance was initialized with styles when created, but had no mechanism to update those styles when they changed. Adding a dedicated useEffect with the styles in its dependency array ensures that whenever the style properties change (through Settings or Type Management panel), those changes are immediately applied to the Cytoscape instance without requiring a page refresh.

### April 20, 2025

#### [12:15] - T26: Fix BrowserFS in Vercel Deployment

- Created `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/public/vendor/` directory for third-party scripts

  - Added script: `"prebuild": "mkdir -p public/vendor && cp node_modules/browserfs/dist/browserfs.min.js public/vendor/"`
- Modified `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/main.tsx`:
  - Enhanced error logging with environment details for better debugging
  - Added detailed environment checks when file system initialization fails
- Updated memory bank files:
  - Added task T26 to tasks.md
  - Added detailed error entry to errorLog.md
  - Updated edit_history.md with file modifications

Fixed BrowserFS loading issue in Vercel deployment by ensuring the script is available from a public path instead of node_modules. Added reliability improvements with CDN fallback and better error reporting for troubleshooting. The solution addresses the root cause - node_modules not being available in production builds - and provides multiple layers of reliability with script copying during build and CDN fallback at runtime.
