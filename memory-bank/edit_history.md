## April 14, 2025
### 16:30 - Fixed Network Node/Edge Deletion Issues
- Modified `src/components/workspace/NetworkInteractionManager/hooks/useNetworkInteractions.ts`: Added state to track deletion time and wrap deletion callbacks
- Modified `src/components/workspace/NetworkInteractionManager/hooks/useNetworkInteractions.ts`: Added timeout for reattaching handlers after deletion
- Modified `src/components/workspace/NetworkInteractionManager/handlers/canvasHandlers.ts`: Improved placeholder node deletion logic

These changes fix three issues with network element deletion:
1. After deleting the first edge, cannot delete additional edges without re-entering delete mode
2. Similar issue with node deletion requiring mode reset between deletions
3. Placeholder nodes not being properly deleted

## April 14, 2025
### 12:55 - Fix Time Slider Update Issues
- Modified `src/hooks/useReduxSimulation.ts`: Replaced setInterval with setTimeout for better control
- Modified `src/hooks/useReduxSimulation.ts`: Added proper component mount tracking
- Modified `src/hooks/useSimulation.ts`: Fixed incorrect time comparison in animation loop
- Modified `src/hooks/useSimulation.ts`: Added lastTimeRef to properly track time changes

These changes fix the issue with the time slider not updating during simulation by ensuring time updates are correctly propagated from the simulation engine to the UI components.

### 12:45 - Fix Infinite Update Loop Issue
- Modified `src/components/panels/SimulationControlPanel.tsx`: Removed console.log in alpha slider onChange handler
- Modified `src/hooks/useReduxSimulation.ts`: Added safeguards against re-entrancy in parameter update cycles
- Modified `src/hooks/useReduxSimulation.ts`: Improved sync function with rate limiting
- Modified `src/hooks/useReduxSimulation.ts`: Enhanced updateParametersWithRedux to prevent state feedback loops

These changes address the "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors by breaking circular update cycles between Redux state and the simulation engine. The issue was caused by bidirectional synchronization that created an infinite loop of updates when parameters were changed.
