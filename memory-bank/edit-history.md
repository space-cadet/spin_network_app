# Edit History

## April 12, 2025 - Build Optimizations and Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript errors in test-simulation.ts:
  - Changed timestamp format in network metadata from string (ISO format) to number (Unix timestamp)
  - Updated metadata.created and metadata.modified to use Date.now() instead of new Date().toISOString()
- Implemented Vite chunk optimization:
  - Added chunk splitting configuration to vite.config.ts
  - Separated vendor libraries into dedicated chunks (react, cytoscape, etc.)
  - Set appropriate chunk size warning limits
  - Enabled cssCodeSplit and modern browser targeting
  - Reduced bundle size from ~1MB to multiple smaller chunks

## April 11, 2025 - Workspace Component Refactoring
- Refactored Workspace.tsx into multiple specialized components:
  - CytoscapeManager - For graph visualization and cytoscape lifecycle
  - NetworkInteractionManager - For interaction handling (node/edge creation, deletion)
  - SimulationVisualizationManager - For simulation state visualization
  - WorkspaceControls - For toolbar and control buttons
  - NetworkStatusBar - For displaying network statistics and interaction mode
- Extracted utility functions into dedicated modules:
  - cytoscapeSetup.ts - Cytoscape initialization and configuration
  - viewportUtils.ts - Zoom and viewport operations
  - nodeHandlers.ts - Node creation, placeholder conversion, etc.
  - edgeHandlers.ts - Edge creation, dangling edges, etc.
  - canvasHandlers.ts - Canvas interactions and setup
  - visualizationUtils.ts - Visualization state handling
  - animationController.ts - Animation timing and control
- Implemented custom hooks for state management:
  - useCytoscapeInstance - Cytoscape lifecycle management
  - useNetworkInteractions - Interaction state and bindings
  - useSimulationVisualization - Simulation visualization state
- Reduced Workspace.tsx from 1400+ lines to ~300 lines
- Created appropriate directory structure for new components

## April 9, 2025 - Workspace Refactoring Plan
- Created detailed refactoring plan for Workspace.tsx component
- Identified components to extract and their responsibilities
- Outlined directory structure and file organization
- Defined component interfaces and data flow
