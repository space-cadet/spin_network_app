## Task Details

### T36: Implement Tensor and State Vector Sandbox
**Description**: Create a test sandbox to experiment with enhanced tensor-based representation of nodes and state vector representation of edges in spin networks before integrating these features into the main application.
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Started**: April 22, 2025
**Last Active**: April 22, 2025 (14:45 IST)
**Dependencies**: T20, T35
**Completion Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Create implementation plan in `/memory-bank/implementation-details/tensor-test.md`
- ‚¨ú Design enhanced TensorNode and StateVectorEdge data structures
- ‚¨ú Create HTML test page for the sandbox
- ‚¨ú Implement tensor operations module (creation, element access, contraction)
- ‚¨ú Implement state vector operations module (quantum state vectors)
- ‚¨ú Create tensor factory functions for intertwiner generation
- ‚¨ú Implement simple visualization for tensors and state vectors
- ‚¨ú Add test cases for validation against analytical solutions
- ‚¨ú Implement time evolution of tensors during simulation
- ‚¨ú Connect with existing intertwinerSpace.ts implementation
- ‚¨ú Add documentation on tensor operations and representations

**Related Files**:
- `/memory-bank/implementation-details/tensor-test.md` - Implementation plan
- `/lib/core/tensor.ts` - To be created
- `/lib/core/intertwinerSpace.ts` - Existing implementation to build on
- `/lib/quantum/tensorOperations.ts` - To be created
- `/lib/quantum/stateVectorOperations.ts` - To be created
- `/public/tensor-sandbox.html` - To be created
- `/public/scripts/tensor-test.js` - To be created

**Notes**:
This task focuses on developing a test sandbox for implementing and validating tensor and state vector operations before integrating them into the main application. By creating a dedicated testing environment, we can explore the mathematical representations and operations independently of the application's UI components. This approach will help us verify that the quantum-mechanical properties of spin networks are correctly implemented before adding complexity with the full application architecture.

The sandbox will allow us to:
1. Test sparse tensor representation for efficient storage of intertwiner tensors
2. Explore quantum state vector operations for representing edge spins
3. Verify that tensor operations like contraction work correctly
4. Test the integration with the existing intertwinerSpace.ts functionality
5. Visualize tensors and state vectors for better understanding

The implementation plan in tensor-test.md outlines the approach in detail, with specific data structures, core components, and implementation phases.

### T34: Complete Simulation Engine Migration to Standalone Library
**Description**: Fully migrate all simulation engine dependencies from the React app to the standalone library, ensuring there's only one version of the simulation engine in the codebase. This task builds upon the work in T1 (Simulation Library Abstraction) and T14 (State Management Architecture) to complete the migration and eliminate duplicate implementations.
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: April 21, 2025
**Last Active**: April 21, 2025 (22:30 IST)
**Dependencies**: T1, T14
**Completion Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Create comprehensive migration plan (stored in `/memory-bank/implementation-details/standalone-lib/standalone-migration-plan.md`)
- ‚¨ú Identify all React components that directly depend on src/simulation
- ‚¨ú Complete any missing features in the standalone library from feature comparison
- ‚¨ú Implement event system and adapter layer for React integration
- ‚¨ú Refactor React components to use adapters instead of direct simulation imports
- ‚¨ú Update hooks (useSimulation, useReduxSimulation) to use the adapters
- ‚¨ú Ensure state synchronization between Redux and simulation engine
- ‚¨ú Verify visualization components work correctly with the library
- ‚¨ú Add comprehensive tests for the integration
- ‚¨ú Remove src/simulation directory after successful migration
- ‚¨ú Update documentation to reflect the new architecture

**Related Files**:
- `/memory-bank/implementation-details/standalone-lib/standalone-migration-plan.md`
- `/memory-bank/implementation-details/standalone-lib/state-management-implementation.ts`
- `/lib/core/engineImplementation.ts`
- `/lib/core/types.ts`
- `/src/simulation/` (entire directory to be migrated)
- `/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts`
- `/src/hooks/useReduxSimulation.ts`
- `/src/components/simulation/` (components to be updated)
- `/src/store/slices/simulationSlice.ts`

**Notes**:
This task represents the final step in the Simulation Library Abstraction project, focusing on fully migrating all simulation logic from the React app to the standalone library. The goal is to ensure there's only one version of the simulation engine - the standalone library version - while the React app only contains the UI-specific code with adapters that connect to the library.

### T35: Enhance Node and Edge Data Structures for Intertwiners
**Description**: Enhance the data structures for nodes and edges in the spin network to better represent the physics concepts, particularly improving the intertwiner representation to support intertwiner spaces with multiple dimensions and basis states. Implement a sparse tensor representation for efficient storage and manipulation of intertwiner tensors.
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Started**: April 21, 2025
**Last Active**: April 21, 2025 23:45 IST
**Dependencies**: T20
**Completion Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Define enhanced `IntertwinerData` interface to replace the simple numerical representation
- ‚úÖ Update `NetworkNode` interface to use the new `IntertwinerData` interface
- ‚úÖ Implement validation function to ensure intertwiner values are consistent with adjacent edge spins
- ‚úÖ Update `networkToCytoscape` function to handle the new intertwiner representation
- ‚úÖ Update any functions that create or modify nodes to support the new interface
- ‚úÖ Maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- ‚úÖ Add utility functions to calculate intertwiner dimension based on adjacent edge spins
- ‚¨ú Add documentation about the new data structure
- ‚¨ú Create tensor data structures for intertwiners (`IntertwinerTensorData`, `SparseIntertwinerElement`, `Complex`)
- ‚¨ú Implement utility functions for tensor operations (creation, element access, contraction)
- ‚¨ú Create factory functions for generating standard intertwiner tensors (3j, 4j, etc.)
- ‚¨ú Add quantum state calculation functions for graph states
- ‚¨ú Implement tensor visualization helpers
- ‚¨ú Add performance optimizations for tensor operations

**Related Files**:
- `/src/models/types.ts` - Core type definitions
- `/src/models/networkModel.ts` - Network model implementation
- `/src/components/workspace/CytoscapeManager/CytoscapeManager.tsx` - Visualization component
- `/memory-bank/implementation-details/tensor-plan.md` - Implementation plan
- `/src/utils/intertwinerTensorUtils.ts` - To be created
- `/src/utils/intertwinerTensorFactory.ts` - To be created
- `/src/utils/quantumStateUtils.ts` - To be created

**Notes**:
The current implementation represents intertwiners as simple numerical values, which doesn't capture the full complexity of the physics model. This enhancement will modify the data structure to better represent intertwiner spaces with their dimensions and basis states, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code. The changes will lay the groundwork for more accurate physical simulations and visualizations of spin networks.

A comprehensive migration plan has been created in `standalone-migration-plan.md` that outlines a systematic approach with seven phases:
1. Identify all dependencies between React components and the simulation code
2. Complete missing features in the standalone library
3. Create a React adapter layer for integration
4. Update React components to use the adapters
5. Comprehensive testing of the integration
6. Remove duplicate implementation
7. Update documentation

The key technical challenge is implementing the proper adapter layer that translates between the event-based architecture of the standalone library and the Redux-based state management in the React app. The work in T14 (State Management Architecture) provides a foundation for this with the EventEmitter pattern and adapter interfaces.

### T33: Fix Documentation Rendering and Interaction Issues
**Description**: Fix the rendering and interactive functionality issues in the documentation system. Address Markdown formatting, script loading, module imports, and navigation problems.
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: April 21, 2025
**Last Active**: April 21, 2025 (18:15 IST)
**Dependencies**: T28
**Completion Criteria**:
- ‚¨ú Fix Markdown header ID anchors that display as `{#anchor-name}` in the rendered output
- ‚úÖ Fix script loading in standalone-guide.html to make interactive controls work
- üîÑ Resolve simulation module loading in simulation-test.html
- ‚úÖ Implement proper routing to handle page refreshes and back navigation
- üîÑ Create a consistent module loading strategy for documentation scripts
- ‚¨ú Bundle required UMD libraries to correct location for both dev and production
- ‚úÖ Update iframe implementation to better handle script resources

- ‚¨ú Test and verify all fixes in both development and production environments

**Related Files**:
- `/src/components/documentation/DocsViewer.tsx`
- `/src/components/documentation/DocsSidebar.tsx`
- `/src/components/documentation/DocsLayout.tsx`
- `/public/docs/physics/*.md`
- `/public/docs/implementation/standalone-guide.html`
- `/public/docs/implementation/simulation-test.html`
- `/public/docs/src/test-simulation.js`
- `/public/docs/src/simulation/index.js`
- `/vite.config.ts`
- `/lib-bundle.config.js`
- `/src/main.tsx` (for routing)
- `/public/_redirects` (for SPA routing)

**Notes**:
The documentation system has been organized with a standardized structure, and significant progress has been made on fixing rendering and functionality issues:

1. ‚úÖ FIXED: Script loading in standalone-guide.html by updating the UMD library path from absolute to relative
2. ‚úÖ FIXED: Page refresh navigation issues by adding proper SPA redirects
3. ‚úÖ FIXED: HTML content processing in DocsViewer with better base path handling
4. üîÑ IN PROGRESS: Simplified simulation-test.html to use global window.SpinNetwork object

Two major improvements have been implemented today:

**Path Fix in standalone-guide.html**: 
Updated the UMD library script path from `/dist/lib/spin-network.umd.js` to `../../dist/lib/spin-network.umd.js`, which correctly resolves the library location relative to the document. This fixes the script loading failures in the standalone guide.

**SPA Navigation Fix**:
Added `public/_redirects` configuration with the rule `/*    /index.html   200` that handles SPA routing properly. This prevents 404 errors when refreshing documentation pages and allows proper back/forward navigation.

Remaining focus areas:
1. Fixing Markdown header ID anchors that still display as literal text
2. Bundling required UMD libraries to the correct locations
3. Testing all fixes in both development and production environments

### T32: Fix Library Build Errors
**Description**: Fix TypeScript build errors in the library bundling process, particularly focusing on interface/type export issues that prevent successful compilation.
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: April 20, 2025
**Last Active**: April 20, 2025 (22:30 IST)
**Completed**: April 20, 2025 (22:30 IST)
**Dependencies**: -
**Completion Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Identify root cause of "IntertwinerBasisState" not exported error
- ‚úÖ Fix interface export in lib/core/index.ts
- ‚úÖ Fix other similar type export issues
- ‚úÖ Successfully build library with pnpm run build:lib
- ‚úÖ Document solution in errorLog.md

**Related Files**:
- `/lib/core/index.ts`
- `/lib/core/intertwinerSpace.ts`
- `/memory-bank/errorLog.md`

**Notes**:
The issue was related to how TypeScript/Vite handles interface exports during bundling. While the `IntertwinerBasisState` interface was properly defined and exported in `intertwinerSpace.ts`, the bundler encountered issues when importing this type in `index.ts`. The solution was to modify the export statement in `lib/core/index.ts` to use a separate, explicit `export type` statement for the interface instead of including it with the regular function exports. This explicit separation of type exports from value exports provides clearer instructions to the TypeScript compiler and bundler about how to handle the interface during the build process.

### T27: Fix Node/Edge Property Updates
**Description**: Fix issue where changes to node and edge properties via Settings or the Type Management panel require a page refresh before being applied to the visualization.
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Started**: April 20, 2025
**Last Active**: April 20, 2025 (16:30 IST)
**Completed**: April 20, 2025 (18:45 IST)
**Dependencies**: -
**Completion Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Identify root cause of property updates not being applied without page refresh
- ‚úÖ Fix the `useCytoscapeInstance` hook to update styles when they change
- ‚úÖ Verify changes work for both Settings dropdown menu changes
- ‚úÖ Verify changes work for Type Management panel updates
- ‚úÖ Test changes with different property types (size, color, border, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Document solution in appropriate files

**Related Files**:
- `/src/components/workspace/CytoscapeManager/hooks/useCytoscapeInstance.ts`
- `/src/hooks/useTypeBasedStyles.ts`
- `/src/components/settings/types/NodeTypeManager.tsx`
- `/src/components/settings/types/EdgeTypeManager.tsx`
- `/src/store/slices/typeSlice.ts`

**Notes**:
The issue was identified in the `useCytoscapeInstance` hook, which initializes the Cytoscape instance with styles when it's created but doesn't update those styles when they change. This means that when node or edge properties are modified via Settings or the Type Management panel, the Redux store is updated correctly, but those changes aren't reflected in the Cytoscape instance until a page refresh forces a reinstantiation of the component. Adding a `useEffect` hook with a dependency on `styles` should fix this issue by applying the updated styles to the Cytoscape instance whenever they change.

### T26: Fix BrowserFS in Vercel Deployment
**Description**: Fix the BrowserFS loading issue in Vercel deployment. Currently, BrowserFS works locally but fails on Vercel with a 404 error when trying to load from node_modules.
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: April 20, 2025
**Last Active**: April 20, 2025 (12:15 IST)
**Completed**: April 20, 2025 (15:30 IST)
**Dependencies**: -
**Completion Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Identify root cause of BrowserFS loading failure in Vercel environment
- ‚úÖ Implement solution to load BrowserFS from public directory instead of node_modules
- ‚úÖ Add automatic copying of BrowserFS script during build process
- ‚úÖ Implement CDN fallback mechanism for improved reliability
- ‚úÖ Add enhanced error logging for easier troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ Verify fix works correctly in Vercel deployment
- ‚úÖ Document solution for future reference

**Related Files**:
- `/src/utils/browserFSConfig.ts`
- `/package.json`
- `/public/vendor/browserfs.min.js`
- `/src/main.tsx`

**Notes**:
The issue was caused by the BrowserFS script being loaded from `/node_modules/browserfs/dist/browserfs.min.js`, which works in local development but fails in production builds since node_modules is not deployed to Vercel. The solution involves copying the script to the public directory, updating the script path in browserFSConfig.ts, automating this process with a prebuild script, and adding a CDN fallback for additional reliability.

### T28: Fix Documentation Path Issues
**Description**: Fix issues with documentation pages not loading correctly in both local development and Vercel deployment. Address 404 errors for documentation markdown files and missing UMD library.
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- `/public/docs/implementation/simulation-test.html`
- `/dist/lib/spin-network.umd.js` (generated)
- `/lib/core/types.ts`
- `/lib/io/serialization.ts`

**Notes**:
Successfully restructured the documentation file organization and fixed the basic path resolution issues for documentation pages. Created a standardized documentation structure in the public/docs folder with proper categorization and consistent file locations. The main documentation pages now load correctly in both local development and Vercel deployment.

Key improvements:
1. Reorganized all documentation into a standardized structure
2. Fixed DocsViewer component to properly handle file paths across environments
3. Added fallback paths to load files from different locations
4. Created dist/lib directory for UMD library
5. Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
6. Added placeholder MD files for HTML pages for consistency
7. Added error handling for script loading issues
8. Moved duplicate files to a deprecated folder for clean organization

While the basic documentation structure and navigation now work, there are still rendering and interaction issues that will be addressed in task T33.

**Dependencies**: -
**Completion Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Add separate buttons for play, pause, stop, step, and reset functions
- ‚úÖ Fix issue where resuming a paused simulation starts a new run
- ‚úÖ Ensure unpausing resumes simulation from where it was paused
- ‚úÖ Implement stop functionality to finalize current simulation for new run
- ‚úÖ Ensure simulation logs continue in the same file when resuming
- ‚úÖ Improve button labels to reflect current simulation state
- ‚úÖ Improve button states (enabled/disabled) based on simulation context
- ‚úÖ Fix visual issues and ensure proper display

**Related Files**:
- `/src/components/panels/SimulationControlPanel.tsx`
- `/src/hooks/useReduxSimulation.ts`
- `/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts`

**Notes**:
Successfully implemented separate simulation controls with correct pause/resume behavior. The UI now shows distinct buttons for play, pause, stop, step, and reset operations, with button labels and states that change based on the current simulation state. Fixed the key issue where unpausing would restart the simulation instead of resuming from the paused state. Added proper stop functionality that finalizes the current simulation session so that pressing play starts a new run. Ensured that simulation logs continue in the same file when a simulation is paused and resumed, maintaining data continuity. These changes provide a more intuitive and predictable simulation control experience.

- `/python/intertwiner-spaces.py`
- `/lib/core/intertwinerSpace.ts`
- `/lib/core/index.ts`
- `/public/physics-notebook.html`

**Notes**:
Intertwiner spaces represent the SU(2)-invariant subspaces at nodes in spin networks. The dimension and basis of these spaces are crucial for quantum spin network calculations. 

Made significant progress with:
1. Comprehensive documentation explaining the order dependence in intertwiner calculations
2. Mathematical formulation of different recoupling schemes and their physical meaning
3. Detailed examples showing how different orderings of the same spins can yield different dimensions
4. Implementation of permutation-invariant functions in Python to ensure consistent results
5. Complete reorganization of the documentation with a logical flow and table of contents
6. Fixed critical bug in the `allowed_intermediate_spins()` function that was causing incorrect dimension calculations
7. Added detailed intertwiner spaces section to physics-notebook.html with proper mathematical notation
8. Incorporated information from error log about the bug fix into documentation

The bug fix ensures that the implementation properly enforces the quantum mechanical selection rules for angular momentum coupling:
- When coupling two integer spins, intermediate spins must be integers
- When coupling two half-integer spins, intermediate spins must be integers
- When coupling an integer and half-integer spin, intermediate spins must be half-integers

This fixed the case of `intertwiner_dimension(1, 0.5, 0.5, 1)` which now correctly returns 2 instead of 3, ensuring that all dimension calculations follow proper angular momentum physics.
