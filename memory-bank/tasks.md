- `packages/graph-core/__tests__/` - Test directory
**Dependencies**: T64
**Notes**: 

Initial Approach (Overengineered):
The initial implementation attempted to create a complex abstraction layer before having basic functionality working:
1. Created extensive type hierarchy before understanding actual usage patterns
2. Built complex state management before having basic graph rendering
3. Added multiple library adapters before proving one working implementation
4. Implemented sophisticated layout algorithms before basic visualization
5. Created comprehensive interface hierarchy without concrete use cases

Corrected Approach:
1. Start with minimal working implementation using Graphology directly
2. Get basic graph visualization working with Sigma.js
3. Add features incrementally based on actual needs
4. Only abstract common patterns after they emerge from real usage
5. Keep the implementation simple and focused on current requirements

Key Lessons:
1. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - Don't build features until they're actually needed
2. Start simple and evolve the architecture based on real requirements
3. Get basic functionality working before adding abstractions
4. Test and validate core features before adding complexity
5. Use existing library capabilities before creating custom implementations

This task implements the graph-core component of the larger T64 Graph-Quantum Integration Restructuring project. The implementation now follows a more pragmatic approach, starting with basic graph visualization and adding features incrementally as needed.
