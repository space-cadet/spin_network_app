## Task Details

### T7: Implement Memory Bank File Rotation
**Description**: Implement the file rotation system for Memory Bank files that have grown too large, starting with errorLog.md. This follows the size-based rotation protocol specified in the Integrated Code Rules.
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Last Active**: April 15, 2025 (09:10 IST)
**Completion Criteria**:
- Create archive directory if it doesn't exist
- Implement rotation for errorLog.md with preservation of recent entries
- Establish naming convention for archived files
- Minimize token usage by using efficient commands
- Document rotation process
- Update edit_history.md to reflect the changes

**Related Files**:
- `/memory-bank/errorLog.md`
- `/memory-bank/archive/errorLog_2025-04.md`
- `/memory-bank/edit_history.md`
- `/memory-bank/tasks.md`

**Notes**:
Used an efficient approach that preserved the most recent 5 error entries while archiving the rest. Used command-line tools to minimize token usage and avoid loading the entire large file. This implementation satisfies the Memory Bank Size Management Protocol from Section 3.6 of the Integrated Code Rules.

### T6: Fix Database Service Errors
**Description**: Fix TypeScript errors in database services that are preventing the application from building successfully. Focus on database initialization, service methods, and type compatibility issues.
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Last Active**: April 15, 2025 (Current)
**Completion Criteria**:
- Fix missing function references (initDatabase, getDatabaseStatus)
- Resolve type mismatches in database service methods
- Fix Promise handling issues in simulationService.ts
- Correct filter conditions in database queries
- Ensure proper typing for all database operations
- Fix window.fs related errors in logMigration.ts
- Validate build success after each fix

**Related Files**:
- `/src/database/index.ts`
- `/src/database/services/graphService.ts`
- `/src/database/services/logService.ts`
- `/src/database/services/simulationService.ts`
- `/src/database/migrations/logMigration.ts`

**Notes**:
These database service errors are preventing the application from building successfully. Fixing these errors is critical for the application to function properly, as they affect core data storage and retrieval functionality.

### T1: Simulation Library Abstraction
**Description**: Abstract the simulation functionality from the UI components to create standalone libraries that users can import into their code to run simulations on spin networks without UI dependencies. This will improve modularity and allow for more flexible usage of the simulation engine.
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Last Active**: April 14, 2025 (17:35 IST)
**Completion Criteria**:
- Create new modular library structure in `lib/` directory
- Move core simulation logic with updated interfaces
- Move and refactor models and analysis tools
- Set up proper entry points and API
- Create clean separation between simulation and UI components
- Add documentation and usage examples
- Test library functionality independently
- Refactor original app to use the new library

**Related Files**:
- `/src/simulation/index.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/engineImplementation.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/types.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/graph.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/stateVector.ts`
- `/src/simulation/models/diffusionModels.ts`
- `/src/simulation/models/solvers.ts`
- `/src/simulation/models/weightFunctions.ts`
- `/memory-bank/implementation-details/simulation-library-abstraction.md`

**Notes**:
Planning phase is complete with a detailed implementation strategy documented. Implementation will proceed in phases with careful testing to ensure nothing breaks in the existing application while we extract the simulation functionality.

### T2: Advanced Simulation Analysis
**Description**: Add more in-depth analysis and visualization of simulation results. Implement additional tools for analyzing simulation data and provide more comprehensive insights into the behavior of spin networks.
**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSED
**Last Active**: April 14, 2025 (17:00 IST)
**Paused On**: April 14, 2025 (17:15 IST)
**Reason**: Dependent on completion of Simulation Library Abstraction (T1)
**Completion Criteria**:
- Add Fourier analysis of simulation results
- Implement spectral decomposition of operators
- Create correlation function calculator
- Add multi-scale analysis tools
- Implement export functionality for analysis results
- Create enhanced visualization components for analysis results

**Related Files**:
- `/src/simulation/analysis/conservation.ts`
- `/src/simulation/analysis/geometricProps.ts`
- `/src/simulation/analysis/statistics.ts`
- `/src/components/simulation/SimulationResultsPanel.tsx`

**Notes**:
This task will be resumed after the simulation library abstraction is complete, as the new library structure will make it easier to implement and integrate advanced analysis features.

### T3: Component Refactoring
**Description**: Break down large components into smaller, more maintainable units. Improve organization and reduce complexity of UI components, particularly in the simulation-related panels.
**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSED
**Last Active**: April 14, 2025 (16:45 IST)
**Paused On**: April 14, 2025 (17:00 IST)
**Reason**: Dependent on completion of Simulation Library Abstraction (T1)
**Completion Criteria**:
- Break down SimulationResultsPanel.tsx into smaller components
- Refactor SimulationControlPanel.tsx into modular components
- Create reusable hooks for simulation data access
- Extract tab components into separate files
- Improve component organization and maintainability
- Implement better state management patterns
- Add comprehensive component documentation

**Related Files**:
- `/src/components/simulation/SimulationResultsPanel.tsx`
- `/src/components/panels/SimulationControlPanel.tsx`
- `/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts`
- `/src/hooks/useReduxSimulation.ts`

**Notes**:
This refactoring will be more efficient after the simulation library abstraction is complete, as the new architecture will clarify component boundaries and responsibilities.

### T5: Enhanced Simulation Test Pages
**Description**: Improve the test-simulation.html page by adding randomized network generation and create a detailed physics notebook page that explains the simulation's mathematical foundations and implementation details.
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Last Active**: April 14, 2025 (22:15 IST)
**Completion Criteria**:

- Create responsive design for all viewport sizes

**Related Files**:
- `/public/test-simulation.html`
- `/public/physics-notebook.html` (new file)
- `/src/test-simulation.js`

**Notes**:
The enhanced test pages will serve as educational resources to help users understand the physics and mathematics behind the simulation. The randomized network generation will allow users to see how different network topologies affect the simulation results. The physics notebook provides a comprehensive explanation of all equations and their code implementations.
