## Task Details

### T24: Enhance Log Explorer with State Persistence and Sorting
**Description**: Enhance the log explorer component to persist state between page reloads and navigation events, and add advanced file display options including detailed file information and sorting capabilities.
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Started**: April 19, 2025
**Last Active**: April 19, 2025 (14:49 IST) 
**Dependencies**: T22
**Completion Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Create Redux slice for log explorer state persistence (`logExplorerSlice.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Integrate slice into main store with persistence (`store/index.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Replace `useState` with Redux for `currentPath`, `selectedFile`, `splitPosition` in `FileExplorer.tsx`
- ‚úÖ Update event handlers in `FileExplorer.tsx` to dispatch Redux actions
- ‚úÖ Enhance `FileItem` interface with `createdAt` and `type`
- ‚úÖ Update `loadFiles` to populate `createdAt` and `type`
- ‚úÖ Update `loadFiles` to call `sortFiles` 
- ‚úÖ Implement full sorting logic in `sortFiles` function (using Redux state)
- ‚úÖ Add sorting UI (clickable headers, indicators)
- ‚úÖ Fix TypeScript errors related to sorting and `fs.readFile` signature
- ‚úÖ Fix DOM nesting warning related to `<tbody>` whitespace
- ‚¨ú Add Details/Content view toggle UI and logic
- ‚¨ú Update file list rendering based on `viewMode` 
- ‚¨ú Implement state persistence using Redux Persist

**Related Files**:
- `/src/components/logs/explorer/FileExplorer.tsx`
- `/src/components/logs/explorer/LogExplorerPage.tsx`
- `/src/store/slices/` (new logExplorerSlice.ts to be created)
- `/src/store/index.ts` (for redux-persist configuration)

**Notes**:
This enhancement will improve the user experience by maintaining the log explorer state across page reloads and navigation events. Users will be able to return to the same folder and file they were previously viewing. The addition of detailed file information and sorting capabilities will make it easier to manage and navigate log files, particularly as the number of log files grows. This builds upon the existing log explorer implementation (T22) to provide a more complete and user-friendly file management experience.

### T23: Implement Separate Simulation Controls
**Description**: Improve the simulation controls UI and functionality to properly handle play, pause, stop, resume, and reset operations with correct logging behavior.
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Started**: April 19, 2025
**Last Active**: April 19, 2025 (11:45 IST)
**Completed**: April 19, 2025 (11:55 IST)
**Dependencies**: -
**Completion Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Add separate buttons for play, pause, stop, step, and reset functions
- ‚úÖ Fix issue where resuming a paused simulation starts a new run
- ‚úÖ Ensure unpausing resumes simulation from where it was paused
- ‚úÖ Implement stop functionality to finalize current simulation for new run
- ‚úÖ Ensure simulation logs continue in the same file when resuming
- ‚úÖ Improve button labels to reflect current simulation state

- ‚úÖ Fix visual issues and ensure proper display

**Related Files**:
- `/src/components/panels/SimulationControlPanel.tsx`
- `/src/hooks/useReduxSimulation.ts`
- `/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts`

**Notes**:
Successfully implemented separate simulation controls with correct pause/resume behavior. The UI now shows distinct buttons for play, pause, stop, step, and reset operations, with button labels and states that change based on the current simulation state. Fixed the key issue where unpausing would restart the simulation instead of resuming from the paused state. Added proper stop functionality that finalizes the current simulation session so that pressing play starts a new run. Ensured that simulation logs continue in the same file when a simulation is paused and resumed, maintaining data continuity. These changes provide a more intuitive and predictable simulation control experience.

### T22: Implement Log File Explorer

The component provides a dedicated page accessible from the main navigation, with capabilities to browse directories, view file contents, download files, and delete files. Added a draggable separator between the file list and content panels for better user experience. The implementation properly initializes BrowserFS when the page loads and handles file system operations asynchronously with appropriate error handling.

The enhancements include expanded sections on Lindbladian dynamics with detailed subsections, fixed quantum commutator expressions with step-by-step derivations, improved mathematical notation consistency, better transitions between sections, and a more comprehensive introduction and conclusion. The document now provides a more coherent and technically accurate reference for researchers working with spin networks across all three mathematical formulations.

### T20: Add Intertwiner Space Implementation
**Description**: Implement functionality for calculating the dimension and basis states of intertwiner spaces for nodes in spin networks with arbitrary edge spin labels.
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Started**: April 18, 2025
**Last Active**: April 18, 2025 (16:45 IST)

- `/python/intertwiner-spaces.py`
- `/lib/core/intertwinerSpace.ts`
- `/lib/core/index.ts`
- `/public/physics-notebook.html`

**Notes**:
Intertwiner spaces represent the SU(2)-invariant subspaces at nodes in spin networks. The dimension and basis of these spaces are crucial for quantum spin network calculations. 

Made significant progress with:
1. Comprehensive documentation explaining the order dependence in intertwiner calculations
2. Mathematical formulation of different recoupling schemes and their physical meaning
3. Detailed examples showing how different orderings of the same spins can yield different dimensions
4. Implementation of permutation-invariant functions in Python to ensure consistent results
5. Complete reorganization of the documentation with a logical flow and table of contents
6. Fixed critical bug in the `allowed_intermediate_spins()` function that was causing incorrect dimension calculations
7. Added detailed intertwiner spaces section to physics-notebook.html with proper mathematical notation
8. Incorporated information from error log about the bug fix into documentation

The bug fix ensures that the implementation properly enforces the quantum mechanical selection rules for angular momentum coupling:
- When coupling two integer spins, intermediate spins must be integers
- When coupling two half-integer spins, intermediate spins must be integers
- When coupling an integer and half-integer spin, intermediate spins must be half-integers

This fixed the case of `intertwiner_dimension(1, 0.5, 0.5, 1)` which now correctly returns 2 instead of 3, ensuring that all dimension calculations follow proper angular momentum physics.

### T19: Implement BrowserFS File Viewer

These additions address one of the major gaps identified in the feature comparison with the React app.
Made significant progress on the library implementation. Completed the core components including state vector, graph, simulation engine, diffusion models, and numerical solvers. The library is now in a usable state for basic simulations, with a functioning API that allows creating graphs, setting up initial conditions, choosing diffusion models and solvers, and running simulations. Still need to implement some advanced features like analysis tools, visualization adapters, and specialized weight functions, but the core functionality is in place.
