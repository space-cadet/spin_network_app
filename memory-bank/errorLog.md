## 2025-08-04 17:58 IST: Settings Dropdown Not Appearing

**File:** `src/components/settings/Settings.tsx` (and related `src/components/settings/SettingsDropdown.tsx`, `src/components/settings/HeaderMenu.css`)

**Error Message:**
No explicit error message was thrown. The symptom was that clicking the "Settings" button in the header caused a slight UI shift, but the dropdown menu did not appear.

**Cause:**
The dropdown component (`SettingsDropdown.tsx`) used `position: absolute` CSS styling. For this to position the dropdown relative to the button, its parent container needed `position: relative`. However, in `Settings.tsx`, the button and dropdown were rendered within a React Fragment (`<>...</>`), which doesn't create a DOM element. This resulted in the dropdown being positioned relative to an incorrect ancestor, making it invisible or positioned off-screen.

**Fix:**
1.  Modified `src/components/settings/Settings.tsx`.
2.  Wrapped the `<button>` and `<SettingsDropdown>` components within a new `<div>`.
3.  Applied `className="relative"` to this wrapper `div` to establish the correct positioning context for the absolutely positioned dropdown.
