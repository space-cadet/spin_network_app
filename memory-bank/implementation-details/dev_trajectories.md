## Recommended Trajectory: Modular Incremental Approach (Trajectory 3)

Based on the current project state and goals, the Modular Incremental Approach offers the best balance of:

1. **Delivery Timeline**: Providing working functionality relatively quickly
2. **Design Quality**: Creating a foundation that supports future enhancements
3. **Flexibility**: Allowing adaptation based on user feedback and evolving requirements
4. **Educational Value**: Supporting basic understanding while enabling advanced features

This approach allows us to:
- Deliver a minimal working simulation early
- Progressively enhance it with more sophisticated features
- Maintain flexibility to adjust based on user feedback
- Support both educational and exploratory goals

The modular design would allow us to incorporate elements from other trajectories as needed, particularly the quantum walk aspects from Trajectory 4 and the research-oriented features from Trajectory 6, while maintaining a functioning application throughout the development process.
