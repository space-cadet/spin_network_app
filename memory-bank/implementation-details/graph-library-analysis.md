## Design Decisions

### Interface Hierarchy
We will implement a comprehensive interface hierarchy to support multiple use cases:

1. **Base Interfaces**
   - `IGraphElement`: Common base for all graph elements
   - `IGraphNode`: Base node interface with type support
   - `IGraphEdge`: Base edge interface with type support
   - `IPropertyMap`: Type-safe property storage

2. **Specialized Graph Interfaces**
   - `ITypedGraph<NodeType, EdgeType>`: Type-safe graph operations
   - `IOrderedGraph`: Support for ordered subgraphs (quantum circuits)
   - `ISimplicialGraph`: Support for faces and simplices (topology)
   - `IRewriteableGraph`: Pattern matching and rewrite rules

3. **Extended Structures**
   - `IFace`: 2D face representation
   - `ISimplex`: N-dimensional simplicial complex
   - `IOrderedSubgraph`: Ordered collections of elements
   - `IMatch`: Pattern matching results
   - `IRewritePattern`: Graph rewrite rules

This design supports:
- Spin networks through `ITypedGraph` and `ISimplicialGraph`
- Quantum circuits through `ITypedGraph` and `IOrderedGraph`
- ZX-calculus through `ITypedGraph` and `IRewriteableGraph`
- Pachner moves through `ISimplicialGraph` and `IRewriteableGraph`

### Implementation Strategy
- Use immutable interfaces throughout
- Support pattern matching and rewrite rules at the core
- Enable type-safe graph operations through generics
- Support higher-dimensional structures natively
- Allow composition of interfaces for specialized uses

### Algorithm Implementation
- Implement algorithms as standalone functions
- Use generator functions for lazy iteration
- Support early termination for search algorithms
- Enable custom comparators and visitor functions

- Recently added native TypeScript support (v3.31.0)
- Well-maintained with good community support
- Primarily designed for visualization but includes robust graph algorithms

**ngraph.graph**:

- **Compound Graphs**: Hierarchical graphs where nodes can contain other nodes (parent-child relationships)

## Implementation Considerations

When choosing whether to build a custom implementation or leverage an existing library, consider:

1. **Integration Requirements**:
   - All libraries would require custom adapters for our quantum package
   - Math.js integration would need to be implemented for any choice

2. **Development Time vs. Control**:
   - Using Graphology would significantly reduce development time
   - Custom implementation provides maximum control over internals
   - A hybrid approach (wrapping Graphology) balances both concerns

3. **Current Usage**:
   - Cytoscape.js is already used in our React components, but primarily for visualization
   - Our SpinNetworkGraph class has existing custom logic that might need to be preserved

4. **Long-term Maintenance**:
   - Libraries reduce maintenance burden for core graph algorithms
   - Custom code increases maintenance needs but provides more flexibility

## Implementation Approach

### Initial Prototype: Graph Testing Application

Before committing to a full implementation strategy, we'll first create a dedicated testing application to evaluate the different graph libraries. This approach will allow for direct comparison of Graphology and Cytoscape.js in terms of API usability, performance, and integration potential.

#### Graph Testing App Structure

The test application will be created as a separate package, with common interfaces defined in graph-core:

```
/packages/graph-core/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts            # Common interfaces and types
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AbstractGraph.ts    # Interface definition for graphs

/packages/graph-test-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json            # Package configuration with both libraries as dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vite.config.ts          # Vite build configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx             # Main application component
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx           # Entry point
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/         # App-specific components
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GraphCanvas.tsx     # Graph visualization component
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ControlPanel.tsx    # Left panel controls
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ InfoPanel.tsx       # Right panel information
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backends/           # Graph library implementations (for testing)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ graphology/     # Graphology implementation
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cytoscape/      # Cytoscape implementation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/              # Utility functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ public/                 # Static assets
```

This hybrid approach:
1. Defines core interfaces in graph-core (where they ultimately belong)
2. Keeps implementation experiments in graph-test-app for flexibility
3. Provides a clear path for migrating the chosen implementation to graph-core after evaluation

This test app will reuse components from the template-core package to provide a consistent UI experience with the rest of the application.

#### Testing App Features

The app will include:

1. **Left Panel**: Controls for graph operations
   - Create node
   - Create edge
   - Remove node/edge
   - Graph algorithms (e.g., shortest path, centrality)
   - Choose between Graphology/Cytoscape backends

2. **Main Panel**: Graph visualization area
   - Interactive visualization of the graph
   - Click/drag to interact with nodes/edges

3. **Right Panel**: Properties and information
   - Selected node/edge properties
   - Graph statistics
   - Performance metrics for operations

4. **Bottom Panel**: Console/logs
   - View operation results
   - See timing information
   - Debug outputs

#### Implementation Strategy

Based on the testing results, we will then proceed with the full graph-core package implementation using the better-suited library, or a custom implementation if neither meets our needs. The graph-core package will then build upon these findings to create a robust, reusable graph structure package.

## Notes
This task implements the abstract graph component of the larger T64 Graph-Quantum Integration Restructuring project. The graph-core package provides the foundation for the new architectural approach by creating abstract graph structures that can later be extended with quantum-specific functionality in the spin-network package.

Rather than building everything from scratch, we should evaluate using Graphology or other existing graph libraries as the foundation. If we choose to use an existing library, we should focus on creating appropriate wrappers and extensions that integrate well with our quantum package.

Performance will be critical, especially for large graph operations that may be needed for complex quantum networks. We should benchmark different approaches before committing to a specific implementation strategy.

Our existing SpiNetworkGraph in lib/graph contains custom implementation that already integrates with math.js for matrix operations. If we choose to use a library, we need to ensure it can either replicate this functionality or provide additional benefits that justify the migration effort.
