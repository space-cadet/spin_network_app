## Theoretical Correctness Considerations

Throughout implementation, the following principles will be prioritized:

1. **Mathematical Accuracy**: Ensure numerical methods preserve the mathematical properties of the continuous equations
2. **Conservation Properties**: Verify conservation of relevant quantities (e.g., total probability)
3. **Convergence Testing**: Implement tests to verify convergence to correct solutions
4. **Error Analysis**: Add tools to estimate numerical errors in simulations
5. **Reference Solutions**: Compare with analytical solutions where available
6. **Documentation**: Thoroughly document the mathematical foundations and implementation details

This implementation plan will significantly enhance the app's diffusion capabilities, bringing them closer to the rigorous scientific computing approach of the Python implementation while maintaining the interactive nature of the web application.
