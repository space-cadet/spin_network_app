# BrowserFS File Viewer Implementation Considerations

*Created: 2025-04-17*

## Overview

This document outlines considerations for implementing a file viewer for BrowserFS in the spin network application. The file viewer would allow users to browse, view, and manage log files and other data stored in the BrowserFS virtual file system.

## Requirements

1. **File System Navigation**:
   - Browse directory structure
   - View file listings
   - Navigate between directories

2. **File Operations**:
   - View file contents
   - Download files to local system
   - Delete unwanted files
   - Create new directories

3. **Integration Requirements**:
   - Seamless integration with existing React app
   - Consistent with application styling
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Performance optimization for large log files

## Implementation Options

### 1. react-browser-fs-tree

**Pros**:
- Specifically designed for BrowserFS
- Tree-like interface that's familiar to users
- Good integration with React component lifecycle
- Minimal configuration required

**Cons**:
- May require customization to match app styling
- Limited documentation

### 2. browserfs-explorer

**Pros**:
- Lightweight solution
- Simple integration
- Focused specifically on BrowserFS

**Cons**:
- May lack advanced features
- Might require more styling customization

### 3. Custom Implementation

**Pros**:
- Complete control over UI/UX
- Perfect integration with existing design system
- Can be optimized for specific use cases

**Cons**:
- Development time and effort
- Need to maintain custom code

## Technical Considerations

1. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Restrict certain operations based on user roles
   - Prevent accidental deletion of critical files

2. **File Content Handling**:
   - Text file viewer with syntax highlighting
   - Handle large files efficiently
   - Support for structured data (JSON, CSV)

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Lazy loading of directory contents
   - Virtual scrolling for large directories
   - Pagination for file listings

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful handling of permissions issues
   - Clear error messages for failed operations
   - Recovery options for partial failures

## UI/UX Considerations

1. **Layout**:
   - Split-pane view with directory tree and file content
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Consistent with app's existing UI patterns

2. **Navigation**:
   - Breadcrumbs for directory hierarchy
   - Search functionality for finding files
   - Recent files or bookmarked locations

3. **File Operations**:
   - Intuitive icons for common operations
   - Drag-and-drop interface where appropriate
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Basic Viewer**
   - Directory navigation
   - Simple file viewing
   - Basic file operations (download, delete)

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
   - Search functionality
   - File filtering
   - Advanced file viewers for different formats

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Operations**
   - File upload
   - Move/copy operations
   - Batch operations

## Decision

The initial implementation will use **react-browser-fs-tree** for the following reasons:
- Ready-made solution specifically for BrowserFS
- Good balance of features vs. implementation time
- Tree interface matches mental model for file system operations

Custom styling will be applied to match the application's design system, and additional functionality will be added as needed through extension or wrapper components.
