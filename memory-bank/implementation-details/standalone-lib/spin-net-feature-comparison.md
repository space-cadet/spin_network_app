## Feature Gap Analysis

### Major Gaps in the Standalone Library

1. **Graph Templates and Generation**
   - The standalone library lacks built-in graph templates (rings, lines, grids)
   - No random graph generation utilities
   
2. **Visualization Framework**
   - Only interfaces defined, but no concrete adapters
   - Missing framework-agnostic visualization tools
   
3. **Serialization and I/O**
   - Limited support for saving/loading graphs
   - No export functionality for simulation results
   
4. **Advanced Analysis Tools**
   - Some spectral analysis tools are missing or incomplete
   - Missing detailed error reporting for analysis functions

5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - No built-in benchmarking or performance tracking

### Features Missing from Both Test Files

1. **Advanced Analysis**
   - Both test files have limited implementations of spectral dimension calculation
   - Mean square displacement calculations missing in standalone-test.js

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Neither test file has robust configuration saving/loading
   
3. **Complete I/O Functionality**
   - Limited graph and simulation result export capabilities
