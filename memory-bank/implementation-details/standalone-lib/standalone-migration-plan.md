# Spin Network Simulation Engine Migration Plan

*Created: April 21, 2025*

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to fully migrate all simulation engine dependencies from the React app to the standalone library. The goal is to ensure that there's only one version of the simulation engine - the one in the standalone library - while the React app contains only those features necessary for frontend logic.

## 2. Current Architecture Analysis

### 2.1 Duplicate Implementations

Currently, there are two parallel implementations of the simulation engine:

1. **React App Implementation (`src/simulation/`):**
   - Tightly coupled with React/Redux
   - Used directly by React components
   - Contains visualization and UI-specific code
   - Imports specific to the React ecosystem

2. **Standalone Library Implementation (`lib/`):**
   - Framework-agnostic design
   - Separated from UI concerns
   - Designed for reusability
   - Some features still incomplete

### 2.2 Feature Gap Summary

Based on the feature comparison analysis in `spin-net-feature-comparison.md`, the standalone library still lacks:

1. **Graph Templates and Generation**
   - Library lacks built-in graph templates (rings, lines, grids)
   - Random graph generation utilities missing

2. **Visualization Framework**
   - Only interfaces defined, but no concrete adapters
   - Missing framework-agnostic visualization tools

3. **Serialization and I/O**
   - Limited support for saving/loading graphs
   - No export functionality for simulation results

4. **Advanced Analysis Tools**
   - Some spectral analysis tools missing or incomplete
   - Missing error reporting for analysis functions

5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - No built-in benchmarking or performance tracking

### 2.3 Current Integration Points

The React app integrates with the simulation engine through:

1. **Direct Imports:**
   - Components directly import functions/classes from `src/simulation/`
   - Redux state slices consume simulation types

2. **Hooks:**
   - `useSimulation` hook manages simulation state
   - `useReduxSimulation` hook bridges Redux and simulation engine

3. **Redux State:**
   - Simulation parameters stored in Redux
   - Simulation results captured in Redux
   - UI state depends on simulation state

## 3. Migration Strategy

### 3.1 Approach Overview

We'll follow a systematic approach focusing on:

1. **Complete the Standalone Library:** Fill in missing features in the standalone library
2. **Create Adapter Layer:** Develop React-specific adapters
3. **Update Integration Points:** Refactor React components to use the library
4. **Remove Duplication:** Eliminate the duplicate implementation

### 3.2 Guiding Principles

1. **One Source of Truth:** Only one implementation of core simulation logic
2. **Separation of Concerns:** Clear boundaries between simulation and UI
3. **Framework Independence:** Core library should be framework-agnostic
4. **Incremental Approach:** Gradual migration to minimize disruption
5. **Backward Compatibility:** Maintain existing functionality during migration
6. **Documentation:** Document the architecture and integration patterns

## 4. Detailed Migration Plan

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Adapter Implementation

The key to successful migration is a well-designed adapter layer. Based on `state-management-implementation.ts`, we'll implement:

```typescript
// Core interfaces in the library
interface StateManagementAdapter {
  connect(engine: SimulationEngine): void;
  disconnect(): void;
  applyState(state: any): void;
  getState(): any;
}

// React/Redux implementation (in React app)
class ReduxAdapter implements StateManagementAdapter {
  constructor(dispatch: Function, getState: Function) {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  connect(engine: SimulationEngine): void {
    // Set up event listeners
    // Initial state sync
  }
  
  disconnect(): void {
    // Remove event listeners
  }
  
  applyState(state: any): void {
    // Apply Redux state to simulation
  }
  
  getState(): any {
    // Get simulation state for Redux
  }
}
```

### 5.2 React Hook Refactoring

The `useSimulation` hook will be refactored to use the adapter:

```typescript
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { createSimulationEngine } from 'spin-network-lib';
import { ReduxAdapter } from './adapters/reduxAdapter';

export function useSimulation() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const simulationState = useSelector(state => state.simulation);
  
  // Refs to maintain instance identity
  const engineRef = useRef(null);
  const adapterRef = useRef(null);
  
  // Initialize engine and adapter
  useEffect(() => {
    // Initialization logic...
    
    // Cleanup on unmount
    return () => {
      if (adapterRef.current) {
        adapterRef.current.disconnect();
      }
    };
  }, [dispatch]);
  
  // Return a clean API that uses the adapter
  return {
    // API methods...
  };
}
```

### 5.3 Component Updates

Components will be updated to use the hooks that access the adapter:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { useSimulation } from '../../hooks/useSimulation';

const SimulationControls: React.FC = () => {
  const { 
    startSimulation, 
    pauseSimulation, 
    resetSimulation,
    isRunning,
    currentTime
  } = useSimulation();
  
  // Component logic using the hook...
};
```

1. All React components use the standalone library through adapters
2. The `src/simulation` directory is removed or deprecated
3. All tests pass with the new implementation
4. Performance is equivalent or better than before
5. No functionality is lost in the migration
6. Documentation is updated to reflect the new architecture

## 10. Implementation Schedule

| Phase | Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Phase 1: Identify Dependencies | 1-2 days | None |
| Phase 2: Complete Standalone Library | 3-5 days | Phase 1 |

**Total Estimated Duration:** 13-21 days

## 11. Conclusion

This migration plan provides a comprehensive approach to fully migrating the simulation engine from the React app to the standalone library. By following this systematic approach, we can ensure that the transition is smooth, maintains backward compatibility, and results in a cleaner, more maintainable architecture.

The end state will have a clear separation of concerns, with the standalone library handling all simulation logic and the React app focusing on UI concerns, connected through a well-defined adapter layer. This will make the codebase more maintainable, testable, and extensible in the future.
