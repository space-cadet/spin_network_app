# Spin Network Visualization and Diffusion App - Active Context

## Current Development Focus

We have successfully implemented the network data model and network generation functionality. The next steps focus on completing the core network functionality with:

1. **Redux State Management**: Implementing Redux for global state management
2. **Network Operations**: Finalizing the implementation of network editing operations
3. **UI Integration**: Connecting UI components to Redux state
4. **Element Creation**: Implementing UI-based node and edge creation

## Recent Changes

### Network Data Model Implementation
- Created TypeScript interfaces for network elements (nodes, edges, networks)
- Implemented network validation functions
- Developed utility functions for network manipulation (add, update, remove)
- Added serialization support for Cytoscape.js integration

### Network Generation
- Implemented generators for different network types:
  - Lattice networks (grid pattern with configurable rows and columns)
  - Circular networks (ring pattern with configurable nodes and connectivity)
  - Random networks (randomly positioned nodes with probabilistic edge creation)
- Added parameter controls for each network type

### UI Integration
- Implemented temporary context-based state management
- Connected network visualization to data model
- Updated properties panel to display selected element information
- Added network information display (node count, edge count, network type)
- Fixed Cytoscape.js rendering issues for reliable network visualization

## Current Decisions and Considerations

### Redux Implementation Plan
We will be implementing Redux with Redux Toolkit to manage application state:

1. **State Structure**:
   - Network data (nodes, edges, metadata)
   - UI state (selected elements, mode, view settings)
   - Simulation state (future)

2. **Action Organization**:
   - Network actions (create, modify, delete)
   - Selection actions
   - View actions

3. **Slice Approach**:
   - networkSlice for network data
   - uiSlice for UI state
   - simulationSlice (future)

### Network Operation Architecture
For the network operations, we are focusing on:

1. **Immutable Updates**:
   - All operations return new network objects rather than modifying existing ones
   - This approach works well with Redux and enables future undo/redo functionality

2. **Validation**:
   - All operations include validation to ensure network integrity
   - Prevents invalid states like edges connecting non-existent nodes

3. **User Interface Integration**:
   - Operations will be triggered through UI actions
   - Feedback will be provided for invalid operations

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Current Focus)
1. **Redux Setup**:
   - Configure Redux store
   - Create network slice for managing network data
   - Create UI slice for managing UI state
   - Connect existing components to Redux

2. **Network Operations Implementation**:
   - Add support for UI-based node creation
   - Implement edge creation between selected nodes
   - Add element deletion functionality
   - Support property editing for existing elements

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Add visual feedback for node/edge creation operations
   - Improve element selection feedback
   - Add confirmation for destructive operations

### Medium-term (Next Phase)
1. **Undo/Redo Functionality**:
   - Implement action history tracking
   - Create reducers for undo/redo operations
   - Add UI controls for history navigation

2. **Simulation Engine Development**:
   - Implement graph Laplacian calculator
   - Create matrix representations for networks
   - Develop diffusion algorithms
   - Create numerical solvers for time evolution

### Known Challenges
1. Managing complex state transitions while maintaining responsive UI
2. Ensuring consistent network visualization when operations are applied
3. Balancing flexibility and performance in network operations
4. Handling large networks efficiently
