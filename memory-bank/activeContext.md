## Current Task Focus
**Task:** T48 - Test Files Reorganization
**Status:** ðŸ”„ Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 in progress
**Current Step:** Implementing React tensor operations test

## Implementation State
- Completed shared test infrastructure
- Created tensor-operations.html with basic test structure
- Implemented test runner with registration and execution
- Added visualization support for tensors and networks

## Critical Files
1. Test Infrastructure:
   - `/test-reorganization/scripts/modules/testRunner.js`
   - `/test-reorganization/scripts/modules/testLogger.js`
   - `/test-reorganization/scripts/modules/uiElements.js`
   - `/test-reorganization/scripts/modules/visualizer.js`

2. React Tests:
   - `/test-reorganization/tests/react-app/tensor-operations.html`

## Next Actions
1. Complete tensor operations test suite
2. Begin simulation methods test implementation
3. Validate React test functionality

## Recent Decisions
- Using shared modules to maintain consistency across test types
- Implementing visualization for better test result understanding
- Following phased approach to minimize disruption
