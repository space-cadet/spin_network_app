## Implementation Focus
Recently fixed tensor-sandbox.html by adding the missing tensor-bridge.js script and implemented a lattice network option with higher valence nodes. Before that, completed UI enhancements to the application by:

1. Creating a new Testing page with a sidebar layout that allows navigating between three testing resources:
   - Standalone Implementation Guide (standalone-guide.html)
   - Simulation Test Page (simulation-test.html) 
   - Tensor Sandbox (tensor-sandbox.html)

2. Redesigning the Documentation page:
   - Removed the old documentation components and implementation
   - Created a new, simplified documentation page with the same sidebar layout as the Testing page
   - Implemented proper Markdown rendering for .md files
   - Added support for math equations, tables, and other markdown features
   - Made the documentation page load the following resources:
     - Physics Notebook (physics-notebook.html)
     - Intertwiner Spaces (intertwiner-spaces.md)
     - Unified Dynamics Approach (unified-dynamics.md)
     - Mathematical Foundations (mathematical-roadmap.md)
   
3. Updated the main application layout:
   - Removed the "Simulation" entry from the header
   - Added the new Testing page link
   - Adjusted the Documentation page link

These UI improvements provide a more integrated experience for testing and documentation, with a consistent layout that keeps navigation in a sidebar and loads content in the main viewport.

## Task-Specific Context

### T36: Implement Tensor and State Vector Sandbox
We have created a test sandbox to experiment with enhanced tensor-based representation of nodes and state vector representation of edges in spin networks before integrating these features into the main application:

Key aspects of this work:
- Created the tensor-sandbox.html page with a detailed UI for testing tensor operations
- Fixed a critical error related to missing tensor bridge script loading
- Added a "Lattice Network" option that creates nodes with higher valence (4-valent)
- This enables non-zero intertwiner tensor components (nodes of valence 2 have trivial intertwiners)
- Implemented a comprehensive grid layout for lattice networks
- Enhanced tensor-bridge.js to expose library functions when available

The sandbox provides a UI to:
- Create different types of networks (empty, line, ring, lattice, custom)
- Select different visualization modes (network structure, tensor values, state vectors, physical properties)
- Modify tensor elements and state vector amplitudes
- Calculate physical properties like total volume and area
- Visualize network state and tensor components

The key issue fixed was that the tensor-bridge.js file, which defines the SpinNetwork object with tensor operations, wasn't being loaded in the HTML file. Adding the proper script tag fixed the error "window.SpinNetwork.createTensorNode is not a function".

Next steps include:
- Implementing the actual tensor operations module
- Creating the state vector operations module
- Building tensor factory functions for intertwiner generation
- Adding visualization helpers for tensors and state vectors
- Implementing test cases for validation against analytical solutions
- Adding time evolution support for tensors during simulation

### UI Enhancement: Added Testing Page and Updated Documentation Page
We have redesigned and enhanced the application's documentation and testing capabilities:

Key aspects of this work:
- Created a new Testing page with a sidebar layout for navigating between testing resources
- Completely redesigned the Documentation page with the same sidebar layout
- Implemented proper Markdown rendering with support for:
  - Mathematical equations (via KaTeX)
  - Tables and other GitHub-flavored Markdown features
  - Improved readability with proper styling
- Integrated both pages into the main application navigation
- Removed the outdated documentation components and implementation
- Simplified the header navigation by removing the unused "Simulation" link

The implementation now provides:
- A consistent user experience across documentation and testing pages
- An integrated way to access test resources without opening separate tabs
- Properly formatted documentation with math support
- A more maintainable codebase with simplified components
- A cleaner UI with only relevant navigation options

The new pages use a unified design pattern with:
- Left sidebar for navigation between resources
- Main content area that dynamically loads the selected resource
- Proper header that displays the current resource title and description
- Interactive state that remembers the selected resource

### Task T12: Fix Numerical Stability and Add Graph Configuration
We are addressing numerical instability issues in the standalone simulation test page and adding more configuration options:

Key aspects of this work:
- Implemented simulationLogger.ts utility for stability monitoring and structured logging
- Added state normalization to prevent numerical explosion during simulation
- Implemented graph configuration UI for different topologies (line, ring, grid, random)
- Added diffusion model and numerical solver selection
- Fixed pause/continue functionality with proper button state management
- Improved stability thresholds and normalization frequency

Despite these improvements, numerical stability issues persist, with state values continuing to grow exponentially and requiring frequent normalization. Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and implement a more effective solution.

Next steps include:
- Properly implementing the RK4 solver for better numerical stability
- Completing the telegraph equation implementation
- Creating test scripts to systematically evaluate numerical stability of different evolution algorithms
- Fine-tuning stability parameters and thresholds
- Implementing adaptive time-stepping based on stability metrics

### Task T6: Fix Database Service Errors
We have made significant progress on resolving TypeScript build errors in the database services:

Key aspects of this work:
- Created proper TypeScript definitions for window.fs
- Fixed missing function imports in database/index.ts
- Corrected type comparisons between void and number
- Addressed boolean comparison issues in filter conditions
- Fixed Promise handling in simulationService.ts
- Implemented log rotation protocol for the growing errorLog.md file

This task is complementary to T9 and focuses specifically on the database layer of the application.

### Task T5: Enhanced Simulation Test Pages
We have improved the test-simulation.html page and created a new physics-notebook.html page to provide better testing capabilities and educational resources:

Key aspects of this work:
- Added randomized network generation to demonstrate how network topology affects simulation results
- Created a comprehensive physics notebook explaining all calculations with equations and code
- Made sections collapsible and added a table of contents for better usability
- Implemented responsive design for all viewport sizes
- Linked the test simulation page and physics notebook for seamless navigation

### Task T1: Simulation Library Abstraction
We have successfully implemented the core functionality of a standalone simulation library that can be used independently of the UI components. This enables users to import the library into their own code to run simulations on spin networks without requiring the full application.

Key achievements in this work:
- Created complete modular library structure in the `lib/` directory
- Implemented comprehensive type definitions without UI dependencies
- Built StateVector class with complete vector operations (add, subtract, multiply)
- Implemented Graph class with immutable operations for all graph manipulations
- Developed SimulationEngine with full history tracking and simulation control
- Created OrdinaryDiffusionModel and TelegraphDiffusionModel implementations
- Implemented numerical solvers (Euler, Midpoint, RK4)
- Ensured clean separation between simulation logic and UI components
- Designed factory functions for easy instantiation (createGraph, createStateVector, etc.)
- Made visualization adapters optional through proper interface design

The library now has a complete API for creating graphs, setting initial conditions, choosing diffusion models and solvers, and running simulations. It maintains an immutable design for thread safety and includes comprehensive mathematical operations through the MathAdapter.

### Task T2: Advanced Simulation Analysis
This task will implement more advanced analysis tools once the library abstraction is complete. It will focus on providing deeper insights into simulation results through extended analysis capabilities.

### Task T3: Component Refactoring
This task aims to break down large components (like SimulationResultsPanel.tsx with 941 lines) into smaller, more maintainable units, improving code organization and reducing complexity.

## Current Decisions
- The enhanced test pages will focus on educational value and accessibility 
- The physics notebook will be organized in a logical progression from basic concepts to advanced calculations
- We will use collapsible sections and a table of contents to improve navigation
- The randomized network generation will ensure users can see how network topology affects simulation results
- We will implement a responsive design that works well on all device sizes
- The test page and notebook will be cross-linked for easy navigation between them

Other ongoing decisions:
- The simulation library will be structured with core, models, analysis, adapters, and utils modules
- Minimal dependencies will be maintained for the core functionality
- TypeScript will be used throughout with comprehensive type definitions
- The API will be designed around factory functions for easy instantiation
- Backward compatibility will be preserved for the existing application
