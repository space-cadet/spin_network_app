## Implementation Focus
Currently focusing on fixing database service errors (T6) that are preventing the application from building successfully. This includes resolving TypeScript errors related to type safety issues, missing function references, and improper Promise handling. Additionally, we need to implement the log rotation protocol for errorLog.md due to its growing size.

## Task-Specific Context

### Task T6: Fix Database Service Errors
We are resolving various TypeScript build errors in the database services that are preventing the application from building successfully:

Key aspects of this work:
- Creating proper TypeScript definitions for window.fs
- Fixing missing function imports in database/index.ts
- Correcting type comparisons between void and number
- Addressing boolean comparison issues in filter conditions
- Fixing Promise handling in simulationService.ts
- Implementing log rotation protocol for the growing errorLog.md file

This task is critical for enabling successful builds and ensuring proper type safety throughout the database layer. Once this is complete, we'll have a more stable foundation for ongoing development.

### Task T5: Enhanced Simulation Test Pages
We have improved the test-simulation.html page and created a new physics-notebook.html page to provide better testing capabilities and educational resources:

Key aspects of this work:
- Added randomized network generation to demonstrate how network topology affects simulation results
- Created a comprehensive physics notebook explaining all calculations with equations and code
- Made sections collapsible and added a table of contents for better usability
- Implemented responsive design for all viewport sizes
- Linked the test simulation page and physics notebook for seamless navigation

### Task T1: Simulation Library Abstraction
We are abstracting the simulation functionality into a standalone library that can be used independently of the UI components. This will enable users to import the library into their own code to run simulations on spin networks without requiring the full application.

Key aspects of this work:
- Creating a modular library structure in the `lib/` directory
- Implementing factory functions for easy instantiation
- Ensuring clean separation between simulation logic and UI
- Maintaining backward compatibility with the existing app
- Making visualization adapters optional to reduce dependencies

### Task T2: Advanced Simulation Analysis
This task will implement more advanced analysis tools once the library abstraction is complete. It will focus on providing deeper insights into simulation results through extended analysis capabilities.

### Task T3: Component Refactoring
This task aims to break down large components (like SimulationResultsPanel.tsx with 941 lines) into smaller, more maintainable units, improving code organization and reducing complexity.

## Current Decisions
- The enhanced test pages will focus on educational value and accessibility 
- The physics notebook will be organized in a logical progression from basic concepts to advanced calculations
- We will use collapsible sections and a table of contents to improve navigation
- The randomized network generation will ensure users can see how network topology affects simulation results
- We will implement a responsive design that works well on all device sizes
- The test page and notebook will be cross-linked for easy navigation between them

Other ongoing decisions:
- The simulation library will be structured with core, models, analysis, adapters, and utils modules
- Minimal dependencies will be maintained for the core functionality
- TypeScript will be used throughout with comprehensive type definitions
- The API will be designed around factory functions for easy instantiation
- Backward compatibility will be preserved for the existing application

## Next Actions By Task
- T6: Verify build success after fixes
- T6: Implement log rotation protocol for errorLog.md
- T5: Consider adding interactive demos as a future enhancement
- T1: Create new directory structure and set up package configuration
- T2: On hold until T1 is completed
- T3: On hold until T1 is completed

## Implementation Plan (T1)
The detailed implementation plan for the simulation library abstraction is documented in `/memory-bank/implementation-details/simulation-library-abstraction.md` and includes:

1. Creating a modular structure with core, models, analysis, adapters, and utils modules
2. Implementing in phases from directory setup through testing
3. Maintaining architectural considerations like minimal dependencies, clean interfaces, etc.
4. Preserving backward compatibility while creating a standalone library

The implementation will proceed in phases with careful testing to ensure the existing application continues to function properly throughout the extraction process.
