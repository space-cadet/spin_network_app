# Active Context: Quantum Page Implementation in graph-test-app (T64b)
*Last Updated: 2025-05-13 17:45 IST*

## Current Task
**T64b: Implement Quantum Module Demo Page**
- Creating a dedicated page in graph-test-app for showcasing quantum module capabilities
- Implementing quantum state visualization, controls, and information display
- Integrating with template-core layout system and routing

## Implementation Plan
A detailed implementation plan has been created in:
`memory-bank/tasks/T64b.md`

## Current Status
- Basic structure implementation complete:
  - Created QuantumPage component with panel layout
  - Added panel stub components
  - Set up routing and navigation
  - Integrated with template-core layout

## Next Steps
1. Implement panel components:
   - QuantumStatePanel with state visualization
   - QuantumControlPanel with operation interface
   - QuantumInfoPanel with state properties
2. Add quantum state visualization features
3. Create interactive quantum operations interface
4. Implement quantum information display

## Current Implementation Focus
The primary focus is on:
- Proper integration with template-core layout system
- Creating effective quantum state visualization
- Building intuitive quantum operation controls
- Maintaining consistent styling with graph page

## Key Insights
1. **Current Requirements**:
   - Need clear visualization of quantum states
   - Interactive controls for quantum operations
   - Real-time quantum information display
   - Consistent navigation and styling

2. **Architecture Goals**:
   - Clean separation of visualization and computation
   - Intuitive interface for quantum operations
   - Consistent styling with graph page
   - Optimal performance for complex operations

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Build on template-core layout system
   - Follow same panel structure as graph page
   - Maintain consistent navigation
   - Focus on user experience
