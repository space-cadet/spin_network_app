## Current Focus
**Primary Task:** T1: Simulation Library Abstraction
**Secondary Tasks:** T2: Advanced Simulation Analysis, T3: Component Refactoring

## Active Tasks
- T1: Creating a standalone simulation library separate from UI components - üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- T2: Adding more in-depth analysis and visualization of simulation results - ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSED
- T3: Breaking down large components into smaller, more maintainable units - ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSED

## Implementation Focus
Currently focusing on the Simulation Library Abstraction (T1) which involves extracting simulation functionality from UI components, creating a clean API, and ensuring modularity.

## Task-Specific Context

### Task T1: Simulation Library Abstraction
We are abstracting the simulation functionality into a standalone library that can be used independently of the UI components. This will enable users to import the library into their own code to run simulations on spin networks without requiring the full application.

Key aspects of this work:
- Creating a modular library structure in the `lib/` directory
- Implementing factory functions for easy instantiation
- Ensuring clean separation between simulation logic and UI
- Maintaining backward compatibility with the existing app
- Making visualization adapters optional to reduce dependencies

### Task T2: Advanced Simulation Analysis
This task will implement more advanced analysis tools once the library abstraction is complete. It will focus on providing deeper insights into simulation results through extended analysis capabilities.

### Task T3: Component Refactoring
This task aims to break down large components (like SimulationResultsPanel.tsx with 941 lines) into smaller, more maintainable units, improving code organization and reducing complexity.

## Current Decisions
- The library will be structured with core, models, analysis, adapters, and utils modules
- Minimal dependencies will be maintained for the core functionality
- TypeScript will be used throughout with comprehensive type definitions
- The API will be designed around factory functions for easy instantiation
- Backward compatibility will be preserved for the existing application

## Next Actions By Task
- T1: Create new directory structure and set up package configuration
- T2: On hold until T1 is completed
- T3: On hold until T1 is completed

## Accomplished Objectives
The following major tasks have been completed prior to the current focus:

1. ‚úÖ **Redux State Management**: Implemented Redux for global state management
2. ‚úÖ **Network Operations**: Implemented reliable UI-based node/edge creation and deletion
3. ‚úÖ **UI Integration**: Connected UI components to Redux state
4. ‚úÖ **Type Management**: Implemented comprehensive type management UI with Redux integration
5. ‚úÖ **Simulation Core Infrastructure**: Implemented simulation component with diffusion models and solvers
6. ‚úÖ **Simulation UI Interface**: Created comprehensive control panel for simulation control
7. ‚úÖ **Simulation Error Handling**: Added robust error handling and user feedback
8. ‚úÖ **Performance Optimization**: Fixed infinite rendering loops and improved React component stability
9. ‚úÖ **Simulation Redux Integration**: Integrated simulation state with Redux for better state management
10. ‚úÖ **Log Management and Database Integration**: Completed Dexie.js database implementation for logs
11. ‚úÖ **Simulation Performance**: Fixed infinite update loops and time slider updating issues
12. ‚úÖ **Network Element Deletion**: Fixed issues with multiple element deletion
13. ‚úÖ **UI Component Styling**: Fixed PrimeReact dropdown transparency issues and improved UI consistency

## Recent Improvements
- UI organization and component structure improved for better user experience
- Application logs and simulation logs properly separated
- Simulation component performance and stability significantly improved
- React state management optimized to prevent infinite update loops
- Time slider now updates correctly during simulation
- Network element deletion works reliably without needing to toggle modes
- PrimeReact dropdown transparency issues fixed in Application Logs panel
- UI styling consistency improved for dropdown components

## Implementation Plan (T1)
The detailed implementation plan for the simulation library abstraction is documented in `/memory-bank/implementation-details/simulation-library-abstraction.md` and includes:

1. Creating a modular structure with core, models, analysis, adapters, and utils modules
2. Implementing in phases from directory setup through testing
3. Maintaining architectural considerations like minimal dependencies, clean interfaces, etc.
4. Preserving backward compatibility while creating a standalone library

The implementation will proceed in phases with careful testing to ensure the existing application continues to function properly throughout the extraction process.
