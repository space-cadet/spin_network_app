## Current Task Focus
**Task:** T48 - Test Files Reorganization
**Status:** ðŸ”„ Standalone test implementation in progress
**Current Step:** Implementing consolidated test suite with state persistence

## Implementation State
- Created consolidated spin-network-suite.html test file
- Implemented basic test infrastructure in test-suite.js
- Added graph configuration panel with multiple graph types
- Added results display panel for geometric properties and statistics
- Implemented state persistence using localStorage

## Critical Files
1. Test Suite:
   - `/docs/implementation/spin-network-suite.html`
   - `/docs/static/scripts/test-suite.js`

## Next Actions
1. Complete tensor operations test suite
2. Begin simulation methods test implementation
3. Validate React test functionality

## Recent Decisions
- Using shared modules to maintain consistency across test types
- Implementing visualization for better test result understanding
- Following phased approach to minimize disruption
