## Current Decisions and Considerations

### Cytoscape Event Binding Strategy
We're addressing event binding issues with Cytoscape in TypeScript:

1. **Import Style**:
   - Switched from default imports to namespace imports with `import * as cytoscape`
   - This ensures proper typing for Cytoscape APIs and methods

2. **Event Handler Definitions**:
   - Changed from `function` declarations to function expressions with `const`
   - This preserves reference equality for adding/removing event handlers

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added defensive programming with null checks before event binding
   - Ensuring proper cleanup on component unmount
   - Adding more type annotations to help TypeScript understand the code

4. **Type Compatibility**:
   - Current error suggests handler function type doesn't match expected string type
   - May need to adjust how we're binding events or use type assertions
   - Considering creating local type definitions for better compatibility

### Refactoring Strategy
1. **Component Separation**:
   - Separated concerns into manageable, specialized components
   - Improved type safety throughout the implementation
   - Created clear boundaries between components with well-defined props
   - Added explicit communication channels between components

2. **Error Handling Approach**:
   - Added defensive programming throughout the codebase
   - Improved null and undefined checks in critical areas
   - Added clear error messages and logging
   - Implemented graceful fallbacks when errors occur

3. **State Synchronization**:
   - Ensured proper propagation of state between components
   - Added validation for critical data like node IDs
   - Implemented timeouts to handle race conditions
   - Added checks to ensure data consistency
