# Spin Network Visualization and Diffusion App - Active Context

## Current Development Focus

The project is transitioning from initial UI development to implementing core network functionality. Based on a revised prioritization, we are now focusing on:

1. **Network Data Model**: Implementing the foundational data structures for spin networks
2. **Network Operations**: Creating functionality for network generation and manipulation
3. **State Management**: Establishing Redux for global state management
4. **Simulation Engine**: Planning for the diffusion algorithms implementation

## Recent Changes

### UI Implementation
- Created the basic application structure with React and TypeScript
- Implemented a responsive layout with resizable panels for all sides
- Added network visualization canvas using Cytoscape.js
- Created tool panels for network creation and editing
- Added property panel for editing network elements
- Implemented simulation control interface
- Added placeholder energy plot visualization
- Improved resize handles for better visibility and usability

### Project Setup
- Set up Vite as the build tool
- Configured Tailwind CSS for styling
- Set up pnpm as the package manager
- Added linting and formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- Created basic project documentation

## Current Decisions and Considerations

### Development Plan
We have established a three-phase development plan:

1. **Phase 1: Core Network Functionality**
   - Basic network data model implementation
   - Network operations development
   - Redux state management setup

2. **Phase 2: History and Simulation**
   - Undo/redo functionality
   - Simulation engine development
   - Initial data visualization

3. **Phase 3: User Interface and Experience**
   - Simulation control interface
   - Save/load functionality
   - UI refinements and user experience improvements

### Technical Considerations

1. **Data Model Design**:
   - TypeScript interfaces for all network elements
   - Validation logic for network integrity
   - Efficient data structures for simulation operations

2. **State Management Architecture**:
   - Redux slice organization
   - Action creators for network operations
   - State normalization for efficient access

3. **Component Integration**:
   - Connecting Redux state to UI components
   - Maintaining separation of concerns
   - Ensuring reactive updates to visualization

## Next Steps
