# Spin Network Visualization and Diffusion App - Active Context

## Current Development Focus

We have successfully implemented the network data model, network generation functionality, Redux state management, and UI-based network operations. The next steps focus on moving towards simulation capabilities:

1. ✅ **Redux State Management**: Implemented Redux for global state management
2. ✅ **Network Operations**: Implemented UI-based node/edge creation and deletion
3. ✅ **UI Integration**: Connected UI components to Redux state
4. ✅ **Element Creation**: Implemented UI-based node and edge creation

## Recent Changes

### Network Operations Implementation
- Added UI-based interaction modes (select, pan, add node, add edge, delete)
- Implemented node creation by clicking on the canvas
- Implemented edge creation through source/target node selection
- Added element deletion with confirmation dialogs
- Enhanced the workspace toolbar with visual feedback for active modes
- Implemented mode toggling for better user experience

### UI Enhancements
- Added visual feedback for the current interaction mode
- Implemented status indicators to guide users through operations
- Added visual highlighting for nodes during edge creation
- Improved cursor feedback based on the active mode
- Fixed various issues with Cytoscape.js integration

### Bug Fixes and Technical Improvements
- Resolved issues with Cytoscape.js styling warnings
- Fixed edge creation preview functionality
- Improved event handling for interaction modes
- Enhanced deletion workflow with proper confirmation dialogs
- Fixed issues with event handler persistence across operations

## Current Decisions and Considerations

### UI-Based Network Operations Architecture
We've implemented a comprehensive system for network manipulation:

1. **Interaction Modes**:
   - Select mode for selecting elements
   - Pan mode for navigating the network
   - Add Node mode for creating nodes by clicking
   - Add Edge mode for connecting nodes
   - Delete mode for removing elements

2. **User Experience**:
   - Toggle behavior for mode buttons (click again to deactivate)
   - Persistent modes for creating multiple elements
   - Visual feedback through status indicators
   - Cursor changes based on active mode

3. **Operation Workflow**:
   - Clear steps for edge creation (source then target)
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
   - Visual highlighting for intermediate states (e.g., selected source node)

### Implementation Challenges
We addressed several technical challenges:

1. **Cytoscape.js Integration**:
   - Managed event bindings for different interaction modes
   - Handled edge creation preview without styling warnings
   - Fixed selection behavior during operations
   - Maintained visual consistency during operations

2. **Redux Integration**:
   - Connected UI operations to Redux actions
   - Maintained state consistency during operations
   - Provided proper user feedback through the UI

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Current Focus)
1. **Simulation Engine Development**:
   - Implement graph Laplacian calculator
   - Create matrix representations for networks
