# Active Context: Graph-Quantum Integration Restructuring (T64)
*Last Updated: 2025-05-12 20:30 IST*

## Current Task
**T64: Graph-Quantum Integration Restructuring**
- Redesign and restructure the library to create proper abstract graph tools that integrate with quantum module
- Build modular package architecture with all code in packages/
- Create clear abstractions for graph structures, tensors, and their integration with quantum states

## Implementation Plan
A detailed implementation plan has been created in:
`memory-bank/implementation-details/graph-quantum-integration-plan.md`

## Current Status
- Phase 1 completed: Package Structure and Quantum Migration
- Created packages/quantum directory structure
- Migrated all files from lib/quantum to packages/quantum
- Created proper package configuration
- Updated imports to reflect new directory structure
- Created comprehensive migration report

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 2: Abstract Graph Implementation
   - Create packages/graph-core directory structure
   - Implement AbstractGraph class
   - Create graph algorithms and utility functions
2. Run comprehensive tests on migrated code
3. Update imports in main application to use new package structure

## Current Implementation Focus
The primary focus is on:
- Creating consistent package structure
- Proper abstract graph interfaces
- Clean separation of concerns between modules

## Key Insights
1. **Current Issues**:
   - "SpinNetworkGraph" name doesn't reflect abstract graph purpose
   - Tight coupling between graph and simulation concepts
   - Inconsistent organization across lib/ and packages/

2. **Architecture Goals**:
   - Clean dependency flow: quantum → graph-core/tensor-core → spin-network
   - Clear interfaces between modules
   - Proper abstractions for graph structures and quantum integration

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Create new structures in packages/
   - Gradual migration from lib/ to packages/
   - Comprehensive testing throughout
