## New Areas of Focus

### Simulation Results Panel Fix
We need to fix the issue with null values in Geometric and Statistics tabs:
- Need to update SpinNetworkGeometryCalculator to handle edge cases better
- Improve error handling in test-simulation.html
- Enhance data flow from simulation engine to results panel
- Ensure correct calculation and display of physical quantities (total volume, total area, etc.)

### Component Refactoring
Large components have grown unwieldy and need to be refactored:
- SimulationResultsPanel.tsx has grown to 941 lines and needs to be broken down
- SimulationControlPanel.tsx has 633 lines and should be modularized
- Need to create smaller, focused components for better maintainability
- Implement better component organization and reusable hooks

### Redux Integration for Simulation State
The simulation components need to be integrated with Redux persistence:
- Create dedicated Redux slice for simulation state
- Connect simulation components to Redux store
- Configure persistence for relevant simulation data
- Ensure state synchronization across components

### Test Simulation Enhancement
The test-simulation.html file needs improvements:
- Implement random network generation
- Create detailed explanations for calculated quantities
- Document the algorithms used for calculations
- Build step-by-step documentation for the simulation process

### Database Solution for Logs
The log files (errorLog.md, edit_history.md) are growing and need a database solution:
- Research appropriate database options
- Design schema for error logs and edit history
- Create migration plan from text to database
- Implement unified logging service

## Current Decisions and Considerations

### Component Refactoring Strategy
1. **Progressive Decomposition**:
   - Identify logical groupings in the large components
   - Extract each group into a separate component
   - Maintain the existing functionality during refactoring
   - Ensure proper prop passing and state management

2. **Reusable Hook Creation**:
   - Extract common logic into custom hooks
   - Create specialized hooks for simulation data access
   - Implement hooks for calculation and data processing
   - Share hooks across related components

3. **Component Hierarchy Planning**:
   - Design clear parent-child relationships
   - Establish consistent prop interfaces
   - Consider composition patterns for flexible layouts
   - Implement context providers where appropriate

### Redux Integration Approach
1. **Simulation Slice Design**:
   - Determine what simulation state needs to be persisted
   - Identify transient vs. persistent simulation data
   - Create appropriate action creators and reducers
   - Implement middleware for simulation-specific needs

2. **Persistence Configuration**:
   - Decide which simulation data should be persisted
   - Configure blacklist/whitelist for Redux-Persist
   - Handle serialization of complex simulation objects
   - Implement migration strategy for future changes

### Database Consideration for Logs
1. **Storage Options**:
   - Compare IndexedDB, LocalForage, and other client-side options
   - Consider structured data format (JSON) vs. current markdown
   - Evaluate query requirements for log data
   - Plan for log rotation or size management

2. **Migration Strategy**:
   - Design process to convert existing logs to database format
   - Create backward compatibility for existing log readers
   - Implement progressive migration to minimize disruption
   - Add data validation during migration

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Current Focus)
1. **Fix Simulation Logs Panel Display**:
   - Update SpinNetworkGeometryCalculator for robust edge case handling
   - Enhance error handling in test-simulation.html
