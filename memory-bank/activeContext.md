# Active Development Context
*Last Updated: 2025-05-01*

## Current Focus
- Enhancing tensor test output in T36 (Tensor and State Vector Sandbox)
- Adding detailed validation of tensor properties and physical constraints
- Preparing for tensor operations module implementation

## Active Components
### Tensor Tests (T36)
- Enhanced output showing detailed tensor properties
- Added triangle inequality validation for 3-valent nodes
- Added intermediate coupling range checks for 4-valent nodes
- Implemented tensor normalization verification
- Working on core tensor operations module

### Recent Changes
- Added element-by-element tensor verification
- Improved visualization of physical constraints
- Enhanced test readability and organization
- Updated progress tracking in task documentation

### Next Steps
1. Complete tensor operations module implementation
2. Implement state vector operations
3. Add visualization components
4. Connect with intertwinerSpace.ts
