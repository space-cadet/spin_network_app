## Implementation Focus
Currently focusing on fixing TypeScript errors in UI components, hooks, and simulation code (T9) that are preventing the application from building successfully. This work complements the database service error fixes (T6) that were previously our primary focus. The critical issues involve error typing, Redux async action compatibility, component prop type safety, and handling of potentially undefined values throughout the codebase.

## Task-Specific Context

### Task T9: Fix UI and Simulation TypeScript Errors
We are addressing TypeScript errors across UI components, hooks, and simulation code that are preventing the application from building successfully:

Key aspects of this work:
- Fixing error handling in App.tsx and logMigrationUtil.ts with proper type casting
- Resolving issues with Redux AsyncThunkAction types in LogViewerAdapter.tsx
- Adding explicit type annotations for component props and function parameters
- Implementing proper interfaces for simulation state objects
- Adding comprehensive type definitions for Window.fs file system operations
- Fixing TypeScript issues in the hook system, particularly in useSimulation.ts
- Adding null safety checks throughout the simulation engine implementation
- Ensuring proper handling of 'unknown' error types

This task is critical for enabling successful builds and ensuring comprehensive type safety throughout the application. Once complete, we'll have a more robust codebase with fewer runtime errors.

### Task T6: Fix Database Service Errors
We have made significant progress on resolving TypeScript build errors in the database services:

Key aspects of this work:
- Created proper TypeScript definitions for window.fs
- Fixed missing function imports in database/index.ts
- Corrected type comparisons between void and number
- Addressed boolean comparison issues in filter conditions
- Fixed Promise handling in simulationService.ts
- Implemented log rotation protocol for the growing errorLog.md file

This task is complementary to T9 and focuses specifically on the database layer of the application.

### Task T5: Enhanced Simulation Test Pages
We have improved the test-simulation.html page and created a new physics-notebook.html page to provide better testing capabilities and educational resources:

Key aspects of this work:
- Added randomized network generation to demonstrate how network topology affects simulation results
- Created a comprehensive physics notebook explaining all calculations with equations and code
- Made sections collapsible and added a table of contents for better usability
- Implemented responsive design for all viewport sizes
- Linked the test simulation page and physics notebook for seamless navigation

### Task T1: Simulation Library Abstraction
We are abstracting the simulation functionality into a standalone library that can be used independently of the UI components. This will enable users to import the library into their own code to run simulations on spin networks without requiring the full application.

Key aspects of this work:
- Creating a modular library structure in the `lib/` directory
- Implementing factory functions for easy instantiation
- Ensuring clean separation between simulation logic and UI
- Maintaining backward compatibility with the existing app
- Making visualization adapters optional to reduce dependencies
- Implemented `SimulationHistoryImpl` with full simulation history tracking functionality
- Partially implemented `SpinNetworkSimulationEngineImpl` including core simulation step logic and state management
- Updated related types and interfaces to support new implementations
- Continued refactoring and testing of core engine components for standalone library integration

### Task T2: Advanced Simulation Analysis
This task will implement more advanced analysis tools once the library abstraction is complete. It will focus on providing deeper insights into simulation results through extended analysis capabilities.

### Task T3: Component Refactoring
This task aims to break down large components (like SimulationResultsPanel.tsx with 941 lines) into smaller, more maintainable units, improving code organization and reducing complexity.

## Current Decisions
- The enhanced test pages will focus on educational value and accessibility 
- The physics notebook will be organized in a logical progression from basic concepts to advanced calculations
- We will use collapsible sections and a table of contents to improve navigation
- The randomized network generation will ensure users can see how network topology affects simulation results
- We will implement a responsive design that works well on all device sizes
- The test page and notebook will be cross-linked for easy navigation between them

Other ongoing decisions:
- The simulation library will be structured with core, models, analysis, adapters, and utils modules
- Minimal dependencies will be maintained for the core functionality
- TypeScript will be used throughout with comprehensive type definitions
- The API will be designed around factory functions for easy instantiation
- Backward compatibility will be preserved for the existing application

## Next Actions By Task
- T9: Fix remaining AsyncThunkAction type issues in LogViewerAdapter.tsx
- T9: Resolve the remaining boolean | undefined issue in SimulationResultsPanel.tsx
- T9: Fix any other remaining type issues after validation with build
- T9: Verify final build success after all fixes
- T6: Verify database service fixes in conjunction with T9 fixes
- T5: Consider adding interactive demos as a future enhancement
- T1: Create new directory structure and set up package configuration
- T2: On hold until T1 is completed
- T3: On hold until T1 is completed
