## Current Decisions and Considerations

### UI Improvements and Bug Fixes
We've made several key improvements to the UI and workflow:

1. **Toolbar Organization**:
   - Moved undo/redo buttons from left sidebar to main toolbar for better visibility and accessibility
   - Standardized button placement for more intuitive navigation
   - Improved workflow efficiency by grouping related actions together
   - Added dedicated zoom controls with percentage indicator
   - Implemented collapsible sections to reduce scrolling in panels

2. **File Management Enhancements**:
   - Added timestamps to filenames when saving networks (format: `network-name-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.json`)
   - Improved the "Recent" networks feature to properly load saved networks
   - Enhanced error handling to provide more specific feedback on operation failures

3. **Scrollability Improvements**:
   - Fixed vertical scrolling in all sidebar panels to ensure content is accessible
   - Ensured proper sizing and overflow handling for panel content
   - Added consistent scroll behavior across all resizable panels
   - Implemented persistence for collapsible section states across sessions

4. **Undo/Redo Refinement**:
   - Enhanced history tracking for complex operations involving multiple elements
   - Improved consistency of undo/redo when working with placeholder nodes and edges
   - Added comprehensive logging for better debugging of history state

### Dangling Edge Implementation
We've implemented a comprehensive system for handling dangling edges:

1. **Data Model Changes**:
   - Modified NetworkEdge interface to support null source/target
   - Added position information for dangling endpoints
   - Enhanced validation to properly handle dangling edges

2. **Visualization Approach**:
   - Created placeholder nodes to represent dangling endpoints
   - Used different styling for dangling edges (dashed lines) and placeholders
   - Ensured placeholder nodes link back to their parent edges

3. **User Interaction**:
   - Clicking on placeholders in select mode allows conversion to real nodes
   - Deleting a node preserves its connected edges as dangling
   - Able to connect to existing placeholder nodes during edge creation

### Implementation Challenges
