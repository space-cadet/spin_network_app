## Current Development Focus

We have successfully implemented the simulation component core infrastructure, fixed the build errors, enhanced the simulation capabilities with better debugging and visualization, and resolved rendering loops and performance issues. The following major tasks are now complete:

1. âœ… **Redux State Management**: Implemented Redux for global state management
2. âœ… **Network Operations**: Implemented UI-based node/edge creation and deletion
3. âœ… **UI Integration**: Connected UI components to Redux state
4. âœ… **Element Creation**: Implemented UI-based node and edge creation
5. âœ… **Type Management**: Implemented comprehensive type management UI with Redux integration
6. âœ… **Real-time Type Updates**: Added real-time updates to type management with instant visualization
7. âœ… **Collapsible UI**: Implemented collapsible panels and sections for better organization
8. âœ… **Simulation Core Infrastructure**: Implemented simulation component with diffusion models and solvers
9. âœ… **Simulation UI Interface**: Created comprehensive control panel for simulation control
10. âœ… **Simulation Error Handling**: Added robust error handling and user feedback
11. âœ… **Simulation Logging System**: Implemented comprehensive logging with UI
12. âœ… **UI Improvements**: Implemented collapsible simulation panel with improved tab interface
13. âœ… **Simulation Test Infrastructure**: Implemented standalone test page and fixed simulation test
14. âœ… **Simulation Results and Visualization**: Enhanced simulation results panel with real data display
15. âœ… **Debug Tools**: Created dedicated debug panel with auto-refresh capability
16. âœ… **Performance Optimization**: Fixed infinite rendering loops and improved React component stability
17. âœ… **Simulation Redux Integration**: Integrated simulation state with Redux for better state management
18. âœ… **Simulation Play/Pause and Redux Sync**: Fixed play/pause functionality and ensured Redux state stays in sync with simulation engine
19. âœ… **Log Management and Database Integration**: Completed Dexie.js database implementation for logs, simulations, and graphs, and integrated with Redux and UI
20. ðŸ”„ **Advanced Simulation Analysis**: Adding more in-depth analysis and visualization of simulation results
21. ðŸ”„ **Component Refactoring**: Breaking down large components into smaller, more maintainable units

## New Areas of Focus

- Database and log management infrastructure is now stable and integrated
- Simulation play/pause and Redux synchronization are fixed and tested
- Focus is shifting to advanced analysis, component refactoring, and performance optimization

## Next Steps

- Test log rotation and migration utilities with large datasets
- Refactor large simulation components for maintainability
- Enhance analysis tools for simulation results
