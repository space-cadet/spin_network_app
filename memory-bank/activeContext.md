# Spin Network Visualization and Diffusion App - Active Context

## Current Development Focus

We have successfully implemented the network data model, network generation functionality, Redux state management, and UI-based network operations. The next steps focus on moving towards simulation capabilities:

1. ✅ **Redux State Management**: Implemented Redux for global state management
2. ✅ **Network Operations**: Implemented UI-based node/edge creation and deletion
3. ✅ **UI Integration**: Connected UI components to Redux state
4. ✅ **Element Creation**: Implemented UI-based node and edge creation

## Recent Changes

### State Persistence Implementation
- Added Redux Persist with IndexedDB for automatic state persistence
- Implemented explicit save/load functionality for network files
- Added visual feedback for state saving/loading operations
- Created a reset button to clear persisted state if needed
- Set up migration system for handling future state structure changes
- Persisted UI settings (view settings) between sessions

### Network Operations Enhancement
- Added support for "dangling" edges (edges with one or both endpoints missing)
- Implemented placeholder nodes to visualize dangling edge endpoints
- Enhanced node deletion to preserve connected edges as dangling
- Added conversion of placeholder nodes to real nodes on demand
- Implemented visual distinction between regular nodes and placeholders

### Node Sizing and Visualization Improvements
- Fixed node sizing issues where nodes expanded to fill the viewing region
- Added fixed node dimensions to improve visualization consistency
- Enhanced zooming and panning behavior with better constraints
- Added padding around nodes when fitting the view
- Improved visualization layout for better node spacing

### Edge Creation Workflow Improvements
- Added the ability to create edges to empty spaces (with dangling endpoints)
- Implemented placeholder node creation for dangling edges
- Enhanced edge creation between regular and placeholder nodes
- Fixed event handler issues with node/edge deletion

## Current Decisions and Considerations

### Dangling Edge Implementation
We've implemented a comprehensive system for handling dangling edges:

1. **Data Model Changes**:
   - Modified NetworkEdge interface to support null source/target
   - Added position information for dangling endpoints
   - Enhanced validation to properly handle dangling edges

2. **Visualization Approach**:
   - Created placeholder nodes to represent dangling endpoints
   - Used different styling for dangling edges (dashed lines) and placeholders
   - Ensured placeholder nodes link back to their parent edges

3. **User Interaction**:
   - Clicking on placeholders in select mode allows conversion to real nodes
   - Deleting a node preserves its connected edges as dangling
   - Able to connect to existing placeholder nodes during edge creation

### Implementation Challenges
We addressed several technical challenges:

1. **Cytoscape.js Integration**:
   - Created mapping system to associate placeholder nodes with edges
   - Added type information for node filtering (regular vs placeholder)
   - Implemented dangling edge visual rendering with custom styles
   - Fixed event handler management for complex interactions

2. **Edge Creation Workflow**:
   - Working on issues with creating edges between empty space points
   - Implemented specialized handlers for different node types
   - Added support for connecting edges to placeholder nodes

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Current Focus)
1. **State Persistence** ✅:
   - Implemented automatic state persistence with IndexedDB
   - Added explicit save/load functionality for network files
   - Added visual feedback for persistence operations
   - Created reset functionality to clear persisted state

2. **Fix Remaining Edge Creation Issues**:
   - Fix edge creation between empty points
   - Enhance the edge creation workflow for all scenarios
   - Address edge cases in the interaction modes

3. **Bug Fixes and Refinements**:
