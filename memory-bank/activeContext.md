# Spin Network Visualization and Diffusion App - Active Context

## Current Development Focus

The project is currently in Phase 1, focusing on implementing the core UI components and establishing the foundation for future development. The main focus areas are:

1. **User Interface Framework**: Creating a flexible, responsive layout with resizable panels
2. **Basic Network Visualization**: Setting up Cytoscape.js integration for network display
3. **Core UI Components**: Implementing network tools, properties panel, and simulation controls
4. **Project Infrastructure**: Setting up build system, dependencies, and development environment

## Recent Changes

### UI Implementation
- Created the basic application structure with React and TypeScript
- Implemented a responsive layout with resizable panels for all sides
- Added network visualization canvas using Cytoscape.js
- Created tool panels for network creation and editing
- Added property panel for editing network elements
- Implemented simulation control interface
- Added placeholder energy plot visualization
- Improved resize handles for better visibility and usability

### Project Setup
- Set up Vite as the build tool
- Configured Tailwind CSS for styling
- Set up pnpm as the package manager
- Added linting and formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- Created basic project documentation

## Current Decisions and Considerations

### UI Design Decisions
1. **Resizable Panels**: 
   - Implemented custom ResizablePanel component instead of using a library
   - Panels can be resized both horizontally and vertically
   - Visual handles indicate resize functionality
   - Panels maintain minimum and maximum size constraints

2. **Layout Structure**:
   - Left sidebar for network creation tools
   - Main center area for network visualization
   - Bottom panel for energy/metrics visualization
   - Right sidebar for properties and simulation controls
   - Resizable panels allow users to customize workspace layout

3. **Interaction Model**:
   - Direct manipulation of network elements via Cytoscape.js
   - Tool-based approach for network construction
   - Property panel for detailed element configuration
   - Mode-switching for different interaction contexts (select, pan, etc.)

### Technical Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - ResizeObserver for efficient panel resize handling
   - Event throttling to prevent performance issues during resize
   - Efficient re-rendering strategies for Cytoscape.js

2. **Component Architecture**:
   - Separation of concerns between visualization, tools, and controls
   - Reusable components like ResizablePanel
   - Clear interfaces between components

3. **Future Integration Planning**:
   - Planning component structure for simulation logic integration
   - Creating placeholders for future functionality
   - Designing state management approach for upcoming features

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Immediate Focus)
1. Complete the UI polishing:
   - Fine-tune resize handle behavior
   - Ensure consistent styling across components
   - Add tooltips and help text for better usability

2. Add mock network operations:
   - Implement network creation from templates
   - Add basic node/edge creation and editing functionality
   - Create sample networks for demonstration

3. Set up state management:
   - Implement Redux store
   - Create reducers for network state
   - Connect UI components to state

### Medium-term (Next Phase)
1. Implement network data model:
   - Create full TypeScript interfaces for network elements
   - Implement network validation
   - Add serialization/deserialization for saving/loading

2. Begin diffusion algorithm implementation:
   - Create mathematical models for diffusion
   - Implement matrix generation from networks
   - Create numerical solvers for diffusion equations

3. Add basic simulation visualization:
   - Create time-step simulation controller
   - Implement visual feedback for diffusion process
   - Connect simulation engine to visualization

### Known Challenges
1. Maintaining performance for large networks during interactive operations
2. Creating an intuitive UI for complex mathematical operations
3. Balancing flexibility and simplicity in the diffusion parameter configuration
4. Ensuring accurate numerical methods for diffusion simulation
