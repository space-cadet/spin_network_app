## New Areas of Focus

### Simulation Performance and Stability Improvements

- ‚úÖ Enhanced data flow from simulation engine to results panel
- ‚úÖ Ensured correct calculation and display of physical quantities (total volume, total area, etc.)

### Component Refactoring
Large components have grown unwieldy and need to be refactored:
- SimulationResultsPanel.tsx has grown to 941 lines and needs to be broken down
- SimulationControlPanel.tsx has 633 lines and should be modularized
- Need to create smaller, focused components for better maintainability
- Implement better component organization and reusable hooks

### Redux Integration for Simulation State
The simulation components have been successfully integrated with Redux persistence:
- ‚úÖ Created dedicated Redux slice for simulation state
- ‚úÖ Connected simulation components to Redux store
- ‚úÖ Configured persistence for relevant simulation data
- ‚úÖ Ensured state synchronization across components

### Test Simulation Enhancement
The test-simulation.html file needs improvements:
- Implement random network generation
- Create detailed explanations for calculated quantities
- Document the algorithms used for calculations
- Build step-by-step documentation for the simulation process

### Database Implementation
The database implementation is now in progress:
- ‚úÖ Selected Dexie.js as the database solution for all structured data
- ‚úÖ Designed comprehensive database schema for logs, simulations, and graphs
- ‚úÖ Created service classes with full CRUD operations and querying capabilities
- ‚úÖ Implemented migration utilities for existing markdown log files
- ‚úÖ Added Redux integration with async thunks for database operations
- üîÑ Creating UI components for log viewing and management
- üîÑ Implementing integration with simulation components
- üîÑ Adding graph storage and analysis capabilities

## Current Decisions and Considerations
