4. âœ… **Element Creation**: Implemented UI-based node and edge creation
5. âœ… **Type Management**: Implemented comprehensive type management UI with Redux integration
6. âœ… **Real-time Type Updates**: Added real-time updates to type management with instant visualization
7. âœ… **Collapsible UI**: Implemented collapsible panels and sections for better organization
8. âœ… **Simulation Core Infrastructure**: Implemented simulation component with diffusion models and solvers
9. âœ… **Simulation UI Interface**: Created comprehensive control panel for simulation control
10. âœ… **Simulation Error Handling**: Added robust error handling and user feedback
11. âœ… **Simulation Logging System**: Implemented comprehensive logging with UI
