- âœ… Implemented log rotation protocol for text-based logs
- âœ… Created enhanced logs panel with tabs for simulation and application logs
- ðŸ”„ Testing log rotation functionality during application startup
- ðŸ”„ Testing migration of existing markdown logs to database

### LogViewerAdapter and CSS Isolation Implementation
The LogViewerAdapter component and CSS isolation are now complete:
- âœ… Created component structure using PrimeReact DataTable with scope isolation
- âœ… Implemented log entry detail dialog for viewing log details
- âœ… Added filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities
- âœ… Created Redux slice for logs with async thunks
- âœ… Fixed interface issues and completed Redux integration
- âœ… Added scoped CSS styling to maintain application appearance
- âœ… Created enhanced logs panel with simulation and application tabs
- âœ… Fixed template literal syntax error in log migration utility
- ðŸ”„ Testing with real log data and verifying CSS scoping

### Simulation Performance and Stability Improvements
We've fixed several critical performance and stability issues:
- âœ… Fixed "Too many re-renders" error when pausing simulation
- âœ… Resolved infinite console logging loop causing performance degradation
- âœ… Improved React hooks usage pattern with proper memoization
- âœ… Enhanced state update patterns to prevent render loops
- âœ… Added proper throttling for frequent operations

### Component Refactoring
Large components have grown unwieldy and need to be refactored:
- SimulationResultsPanel.tsx has grown to 941 lines and needs to be broken down
- SimulationControlPanel.tsx has 633 lines and should be modularized
- Need to create smaller, focused components for better maintainability
- Implement better component organization and reusable hooks

## Current Decisions and Considerations

### Database Implementation Decisions
1. **Database Architecture**:
   - âœ… Using Dexie.js for IndexedDB access with TypeScript support
   - âœ… Structured schema with four main tables (logs, simulations, simulationResults, graphs)
   - âœ… Comprehensive data models with proper relationships between entities
   - âœ… Added indexing for efficient querying and lookup operations

2. **Service Layer Design**:
   - âœ… LogService with comprehensive CRUD and querying capabilities
   - âœ… Specialized methods for error logs and edit logs
   - âœ… Support for filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - âœ… Export functionality to JSON and Markdown formats

3. **UI Component Selection**:
   - âœ… Selected PrimeReact as the UI component library for log viewer
   - âœ… Using DataTable component for advanced features like filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - âœ… Adding Dialog component for detailed log entry viewing
   - âœ… Using Toast component for notifications

### Redux Integration Approach
1. **Logs Slice Design**:
   - âœ… Created logsSlice with state for logs, status, and query options
   - âœ… Implemented async thunks for fetching logs, marking as fixed, and exporting
   - âœ… Added reducers for updating query options and managing logs
   - ðŸ”„ Need to add logsReducer to main Redux store

2. **Component-Redux Integration**:
   - ðŸ”„ Connecting LogViewerAdapter to Redux state
   - ðŸ”„ Replacing local state with Redux state
   - ðŸ”„ Dispatching actions for log operations
   - ðŸ”„ Using selectors for accessing log data

## Next Steps
