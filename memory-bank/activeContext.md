## New Areas of Focus

### Database Implementation for Logs and Simulation Data
We've made significant progress on the database implementation:
- ✅ Selected Dexie.js as the optimal database solution for structured data storage
- ✅ Designed comprehensive database schema for logs, simulations, and graphs
- ✅ Created service classes with full CRUD operations and querying capabilities
- ✅ Implemented migration utilities for existing markdown log files
- ✅ Added Redux integration with async thunks for database operations
- ✅ Created LogViewerAdapter using PrimeReact DataTable component
- 🔄 Fixing LogViewerAdapter issues and completing Redux integration
- 🔄 Integrating UI components with database services
- 🔄 Migrating existing logs from markdown to database

### LogViewerAdapter Component Implementation
The LogViewerAdapter component implementation is in progress:
- ✅ Created basic component structure using PrimeReact DataTable
- ✅ Implemented log entry detail dialog for viewing log details
- ✅ Added filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities
- ✅ Created Redux slice for logs with async thunks
- 🔄 Fixing interface issues and completing Redux integration
- 🔄 Adding proper CSS styling and PrimeReact theme integration
- 🔄 Testing with real log data migrated from markdown files

### Simulation Performance and Stability Improvements
We've fixed several critical performance and stability issues:
- ✅ Fixed "Too many re-renders" error when pausing simulation
- ✅ Resolved infinite console logging loop causing performance degradation
- ✅ Improved React hooks usage pattern with proper memoization
- ✅ Enhanced state update patterns to prevent render loops
- ✅ Added proper throttling for frequent operations

### Component Refactoring
Large components have grown unwieldy and need to be refactored:
- SimulationResultsPanel.tsx has grown to 941 lines and needs to be broken down
- SimulationControlPanel.tsx has 633 lines and should be modularized
- Need to create smaller, focused components for better maintainability
- Implement better component organization and reusable hooks

## Current Decisions and Considerations

### Database Implementation Decisions
1. **Database Architecture**:
   - ✅ Using Dexie.js for IndexedDB access with TypeScript support
   - ✅ Structured schema with four main tables (logs, simulations, simulationResults, graphs)
   - ✅ Comprehensive data models with proper relationships between entities
   - ✅ Added indexing for efficient querying and lookup operations

2. **Service Layer Design**:
   - ✅ LogService with comprehensive CRUD and querying capabilities
   - ✅ Specialized methods for error logs and edit logs
   - ✅ Support for filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - ✅ Export functionality to JSON and Markdown formats

3. **UI Component Selection**:
   - ✅ Selected PrimeReact as the UI component library for log viewer
   - ✅ Using DataTable component for advanced features like filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - ✅ Adding Dialog component for detailed log entry viewing
   - ✅ Using Toast component for notifications

### Redux Integration Approach
1. **Logs Slice Design**:
   - ✅ Created logsSlice with state for logs, status, and query options
   - ✅ Implemented async thunks for fetching logs, marking as fixed, and exporting
   - ✅ Added reducers for updating query options and managing logs
   - 🔄 Need to add logsReducer to main Redux store

2. **Component-Redux Integration**:
   - 🔄 Connecting LogViewerAdapter to Redux state
   - 🔄 Replacing local state with Redux state
   - 🔄 Dispatching actions for log operations
   - 🔄 Using selectors for accessing log data

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Current Focus)
