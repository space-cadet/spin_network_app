19. âœ… **Log Management and Database Integration**: Completed Dexie.js database implementation for logs, simulations, and graphs, and integrated with Redux and UI
20. âœ… **UI Organization**: Reorganized log panels to separate application logs from simulation logs
21. âœ… **Simulation Performance**: Fixed infinite update loops and time slider updating issues
22. âœ… **Network Element Deletion**: Fixed issues with multiple element deletion and placeholder node deletion
23. ðŸ”„ **Simulation Library Abstraction**: Creating a standalone simulation library separate from UI components
24. ðŸ”„ **Advanced Simulation Analysis**: Adding more in-depth analysis and visualization of simulation results
25. ðŸ”„ **Component Refactoring**: Breaking down large components into smaller, more maintainable units

## New Areas of Focus

- **Simulation Library Abstraction**: We are abstracting the simulation functionality into a standalone library that can be used independently of the UI components. This will enable users to import the library into their own code to run simulations on spin networks without requiring the full application.

- Previous improvements:
  - UI organization and component structure is now improved for better user experience
  - Application logs and simulation logs are properly separated
  - Simulation component performance and stability has been significantly improved
  - React state management has been optimized to prevent infinite update loops
  - Time slider now updates correctly during simulation
  - Network element deletion now works reliably without needing to toggle modes between operations
  - Placeholder node deletion works correctly regardless of edge association

## Simulation Library Abstraction Plan

We have created a detailed plan to extract the simulation functionality into a standalone library:

1. Create a new modular library structure in `lib/` directory with:
   - Core simulation functionality
   - Diffusion models and solvers
   - Analysis tools
   - Optional visualization adapters
   - Utility functions

2. Design a clean API with factory functions for easy instantiation and clear type definitions

3. Implement in phases:
   - Set up directory structure and package configuration
   - Move core simulation logic
   - Move and refactor models and analysis tools
   - Set up entry points and API
   - Add documentation and examples
   - Test the library
   - Refactor the original app to use the new library

4. Maintain architectural considerations:
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Clean interfaces
   - Type safety
   - Error handling
   - Performance optimization
   - Extensibility

## Next Steps

1. Create the new directory structure for the standalone library
2. Set up package configuration for the library
3. Begin moving core simulation logic to the new structure
4. Update imports and exports to ensure proper module structure
5. Remove UI dependencies from the core code
6. Test log rotation and migration utilities with large datasets
7. Refactor large simulation components for maintainability
8. Enhance analysis tools for simulation results
