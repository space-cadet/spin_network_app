## Implementation Focus
Currently focusing on fixing numerical stability issues in the standalone simulation test page (T12) and adding more configuration options for creating different network topologies and adjusting simulation parameters. The critical issues involve exponential growth of state values during simulation, which persists despite the implemented normalization. We're also enhancing the user interface to allow for more flexible testing of different network configurations and diffusion models.

## Task-Specific Context

### Task T18: Fix Logging File Paths and Structure (Completed)
We have successfully fixed the logging file paths to ensure logs are written to the correct locations:

Key aspects of this work:
- Updated the simulationLogger to properly route logs to the correct directories
- Enhanced the SpinNetworkGraph class with direct graph logging capability
- Added a dedicated saveTestLog method for test logs
- Implemented appendResultsToFile method to continuously log simulation data to CSV
- Improved the BrowserFS directory creation process
- Enhanced the application initialization to verify all required directories exist

The implementation now ensures that:
- Graph creation events are properly logged to `/logs/simulation/graphs`
- Simulation events are logged to `/logs/simulation/runs`
- Test logs go to `/logs/simulation/tests` instead of sessions
- Application logs go to the appropriate subdirectories of `/logs/application`

Future improvements will include:
- Adding .gitkeep files to ensure empty directories are tracked
- Creating a comprehensive README.md for the log structure
- Implementing log rotation policies to manage file sizes

### Task T12: Fix Numerical Stability and Add Graph Configuration
We are addressing numerical instability issues in the standalone simulation test page and adding more configuration options:

Key aspects of this work:
- Implemented simulationLogger.ts utility for stability monitoring and structured logging
- Added state normalization to prevent numerical explosion during simulation
- Implemented graph configuration UI for different topologies (line, ring, grid, random)
- Added diffusion model and numerical solver selection
- Fixed pause/continue functionality with proper button state management
- Improved stability thresholds and normalization frequency

Despite these improvements, numerical stability issues persist, with state values continuing to grow exponentially and requiring frequent normalization. Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and implement a more effective solution.

Next steps include:
- Properly implementing the RK4 solver for better numerical stability
- Completing the telegraph equation implementation
- Creating test scripts to systematically evaluate numerical stability of different evolution algorithms
- Fine-tuning stability parameters and thresholds
- Implementing adaptive time-stepping based on stability metrics

### Task T6: Fix Database Service Errors
We have made significant progress on resolving TypeScript build errors in the database services:

Key aspects of this work:
- Created proper TypeScript definitions for window.fs
- Fixed missing function imports in database/index.ts
- Corrected type comparisons between void and number
- Addressed boolean comparison issues in filter conditions
- Fixed Promise handling in simulationService.ts
- Implemented log rotation protocol for the growing errorLog.md file

This task is complementary to T9 and focuses specifically on the database layer of the application.

### Task T5: Enhanced Simulation Test Pages
We have improved the test-simulation.html page and created a new physics-notebook.html page to provide better testing capabilities and educational resources:

Key aspects of this work:
- Added randomized network generation to demonstrate how network topology affects simulation results
- Created a comprehensive physics notebook explaining all calculations with equations and code
- Made sections collapsible and added a table of contents for better usability
- Implemented responsive design for all viewport sizes
- Linked the test simulation page and physics notebook for seamless navigation

### Task T1: Simulation Library Abstraction
We have successfully implemented the core functionality of a standalone simulation library that can be used independently of the UI components. This enables users to import the library into their own code to run simulations on spin networks without requiring the full application.

Key achievements in this work:
- Created complete modular library structure in the `lib/` directory
- Implemented comprehensive type definitions without UI dependencies
- Built StateVector class with complete vector operations (add, subtract, multiply)
- Implemented Graph class with immutable operations for all graph manipulations
- Developed SimulationEngine with full history tracking and simulation control
- Created OrdinaryDiffusionModel and TelegraphDiffusionModel implementations
- Implemented numerical solvers (Euler, Midpoint, RK4)
- Ensured clean separation between simulation logic and UI components
- Designed factory functions for easy instantiation (createGraph, createStateVector, etc.)
- Made visualization adapters optional through proper interface design

The library now has a complete API for creating graphs, setting initial conditions, choosing diffusion models and solvers, and running simulations. It maintains an immutable design for thread safety and includes comprehensive mathematical operations through the MathAdapter.

### Task T2: Advanced Simulation Analysis
This task will implement more advanced analysis tools once the library abstraction is complete. It will focus on providing deeper insights into simulation results through extended analysis capabilities.

### Task T3: Component Refactoring
This task aims to break down large components (like SimulationResultsPanel.tsx with 941 lines) into smaller, more maintainable units, improving code organization and reducing complexity.

## Current Decisions
- The enhanced test pages will focus on educational value and accessibility 
- The physics notebook will be organized in a logical progression from basic concepts to advanced calculations
- We will use collapsible sections and a table of contents to improve navigation
- The randomized network generation will ensure users can see how network topology affects simulation results
- We will implement a responsive design that works well on all device sizes
- The test page and notebook will be cross-linked for easy navigation between them

Other ongoing decisions:
- The simulation library will be structured with core, models, analysis, adapters, and utils modules
- Minimal dependencies will be maintained for the core functionality
- TypeScript will be used throughout with comprehensive type definitions
- The API will be designed around factory functions for easy instantiation
- Backward compatibility will be preserved for the existing application

## Next Actions By Task
- T9: Fix remaining AsyncThunkAction type issues in LogViewerAdapter.tsx
- T9: Resolve the remaining boolean | undefined issue in SimulationResultsPanel.tsx
- T9: Fix any other remaining type issues after validation with build
- T9: Verify final build success after all fixes
- T6: Verify database service fixes in conjunction with T9 fixes
- T5: Consider adding interactive demos as a future enhancement
- T1: Implement remaining components (weight functions, analysis tools, visualization adapters)
- T1: Create test cases to validate library functionality
- T1: Add comprehensive documentation and usage examples
- T1: Refactor original app to use the new library
- T2: On hold until T1 is completed
- T3: On hold until T1 is completed
