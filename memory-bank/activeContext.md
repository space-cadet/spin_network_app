# Spin Network Visualization and Diffusion App - Active Context

## Current Development Focus

We have successfully implemented the network data model, network generation functionality, and Redux state management. The next steps focus on completing the core network functionality with:

1. ✅ **Redux State Management**: Implemented Redux for global state management
2. **Network Operations**: Finalizing the implementation of network editing operations
3. ✅ **UI Integration**: Connected UI components to Redux state
4. **Element Creation**: Implementing UI-based node and edge creation

## Recent Changes

### Redux State Management Implementation
- Created Redux store architecture with Redux Toolkit
- Implemented network slice for managing network data
- Implemented UI slice for managing UI state
- Added selectors for accessing state data
- Created custom hooks for Redux integration

### Network Data Model Integration with Redux
- Connected network operations to Redux actions
- Ensured immutability in all state updates
- Laid foundation for future undo/redo functionality
- Fixed edge selection display issue in properties panel

### UI Integration with Redux
- Migrated all components from context to Redux
- Connected network visualization to Redux state
- Connected properties panel to Redux state
- Fixed React hook rules violation in properties panel
- Enhanced property editing with Redux-powered updates

## Current Decisions and Considerations

### Redux Implementation Completed
We have implemented Redux with Redux Toolkit to manage application state:

1. **State Structure**:
   - Network data (nodes, edges, metadata) managed through networkSlice
   - UI state (selected elements, mode, view settings) managed through uiSlice
   - Foundation for simulation state (future)

2. **Action Organization**:
   - Network actions (create, modify, delete)
   - Selection actions
   - View actions

3. **Component Integration**:
   - All components now use Redux for state management
   - Properties panel enhanced to show source/target node labels
   - Network visualization synchronized with Redux state

### Network Operation Architecture
For the network operations, we are focusing on:

1. **Immutable Updates**:
   - All Redux reducers implement immutable state updates
   - This enables future undo/redo functionality
   - Network operations are consistent with this pattern

2. **Validation**:
   - All operations include validation to ensure network integrity
   - Redux actions enforce data validation
   - TypeScript provides type safety throughout

3. **User Interface Integration**:
   - Network operations triggered via Redux actions
   - UI components respond to state changes
   - Clear user feedback for all operations

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Current Focus)
1. **Network Operations Implementation**:
   - Add support for UI-based node creation
   - Implement edge creation between selected nodes
   - Add element deletion functionality
   - Enhance property editing with validation

2. **UI Improvements**:
   - Add visual feedback for node/edge creation operations
   - Improve element selection feedback
   - Add confirmation for destructive operations
   - Enhance Cytoscape.js visualization

3. **Bug Fixes and Refinements**:
   - Address any remaining edge cases in Redux integration
   - Optimize performance for larger networks
   - Add error boundary protection

### Medium-term (Next Phase)
1. **Undo/Redo Functionality**:
   - Implement action history tracking
   - Create reducers for undo/redo operations
   - Add UI controls for history navigation

2. **Simulation Engine Development**:
   - Implement graph Laplacian calculator
   - Create matrix representations for networks
   - Develop diffusion algorithms
   - Create numerical solvers for time evolution

### Known Challenges
1. Managing complex state transitions while maintaining responsive UI
2. Ensuring consistent network visualization when operations are applied
3. Balancing flexibility and performance in network operations
4. Handling large networks efficiently
