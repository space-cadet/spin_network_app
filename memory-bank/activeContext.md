# Active Context: Graph-Quantum Integration Restructuring (T64)
*Last Updated: 2025-05-11 21:00 IST*

## Current Task
**T64: Graph-Quantum Integration Restructuring**
- Redesign and restructure the library to create proper abstract graph tools that integrate with quantum module
- Build modular package architecture with all code in packages/
- Create clear abstractions for graph structures, tensors, and their integration with quantum states

## Implementation Plan
A detailed implementation plan has been created in:
`memory-bank/implementation-details/graph-quantum-integration-plan.md`

## Current Status
- Initial analysis of code structure completed
- Identified issues with current naming and architecture
- Created comprehensive implementation plan
- Ready to begin Phase 1: Package Structure and Quantum Migration

## Next Steps
1. Create packages/quantum directory structure
2. Begin migrating lib/quantum code to packages/quantum
3. Set up proper package.json and build configuration
4. Ensure tests are migrated and passing

## Current Implementation Focus
The primary focus is on:
- Creating consistent package structure
- Proper abstract graph interfaces
- Clean separation of concerns between modules

## Key Insights
1. **Current Issues**:
   - "SpinNetworkGraph" name doesn't reflect abstract graph purpose
   - Tight coupling between graph and simulation concepts
   - Inconsistent organization across lib/ and packages/

2. **Architecture Goals**:
   - Clean dependency flow: quantum → graph-core/tensor-core → spin-network
   - Clear interfaces between modules
   - Proper abstractions for graph structures and quantum integration

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Create new structures in packages/
   - Gradual migration from lib/ to packages/
   - Comprehensive testing throughout
