## Current Status

The application is in the initial UI development phase. We have successfully created a functional user interface with interactive elements and proper layout, but without the underlying simulation and data management functionality.

### Recent Achievements
1. Set up the project structure and tooling
2. Implemented the core UI components
3. Created a responsive layout with resizable panels
4. Added basic network visualization capability
5. Implemented interactive controls for the visualization

### In Progress
1. Polishing the UI components and interactions
2. Planning the integration of the data model
3. Designing the state management strategy

## Known Issues

### UI/UX Issues
1. **Resize Handle Positioning**: Resize handles can be difficult to target precisely
2. **Panel Size Coordination**: When resizing multiple panels, maintaining proportions can be challenging
3. **Scroll Behavior**: Some panels may have scrolling issues with complex content

### Technical Issues
1. **Cytoscape Integration**: Network visualization needs proper sizing and event propagation
2. **Component Performance**: Some components may need optimization for complex networks
3. **Typescript Definitions**: Some type definitions need refinement

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Performance with Large Networks**: Visualization performance may degrade with very large networks
2. **Complex Mathematics**: Implementing accurate numerical methods for diffusion equations requires careful validation
3. **State Management Complexity**: Managing the simulation state across time steps with undo/redo capability will be challenging

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Testing**: Test with increasingly complex networks to identify performance bottlenecks early
2. **Mathematical Validation**: Implement test cases with known analytical solutions to validate numerical methods
3. **Modular Architecture**: Design state management with clear boundaries between visualization and simulation
