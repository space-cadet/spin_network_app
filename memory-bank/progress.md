## Current Work In Progress

### Phase 1: Core Network Functionality
- âœ… Implementing Redux state management
- ðŸ”„ Developing network operations (add, edit, delete elements)
- âœ… Connecting UI components to state management

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1 (Highest Priority)
- âœ… Redux state management setup
- âœ… Connect network visualization to Redux
- âœ… Connect property panel to Redux for element editing
- â¬œ Implement node/edge creation via UI

### Phase 2 (High Priority)
- â¬œ Undo/redo functionality
- â¬œ Spin network mathematics (Graph Laplacian)
- â¬œ Diffusion algorithm implementations
- â¬œ Numerical methods for time evolution
- â¬œ Initial data visualization components

### Phase 3 (Medium Priority)
- â¬œ Simulation control interface
- â¬œ Save/load functionality
- â¬œ UI refinements
- â¬œ User experience improvements
- â¬œ Dynamic network visualization during simulation
- â¬œ Energy conservation plots with actual data

### Additional Features (Lower Priority)
- â¬œ User preference persistence
- â¬œ Keyboard shortcuts
- â¬œ Tutorial or help system
- â¬œ Dark/light theme support
- â¬œ Statistics and metrics calculation
- â¬œ Export functionality for results

## Current Status

The application now has a functional network data model and generation capabilities. Users can create different types of networks (lattice, circular, random) with configurable parameters. The network visualization correctly displays these networks and allows for element selection. The property panel shows information about selected nodes and edges.

We've successfully implemented Redux state management, replacing the temporary context-based solution. All components are now connected to the Redux store, providing a single source of truth for application state.

### Recent Achievements
1. Implemented Redux store with proper TypeScript typing
2. Created network slice for managing network data
3. Created UI slice for managing UI state
4. Connected all components to Redux state
5. Fixed edge selection display in the properties panel
6. Enhanced component interaction through Redux actions

### In Progress
1. Implementing network operations for element manipulation (create, edit, delete)
2. Enhancing property editing with validation

## Known Issues

### UI/UX Issues
1. **Resize Handle Positioning**: Resize handles can be difficult to target precisely
2. **Panel Size Coordination**: When resizing multiple panels, maintaining proportions can be challenging
3. **Scroll Behavior**: Some panels may have scrolling issues with complex content

### Technical Issues
1. **Node Positioning**: Need to ensure consistent node positioning during view changes
2. **Layout Adjustments**: When adding new elements, the layout needs to be adjusted

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **State Management Complexity**: Managing network state with undo/redo capability will be challenging
2. **Performance with Large Networks**: Visualization and manipulation performance may degrade with very large networks
3. **Complex Mathematics**: Implementing accurate numerical methods for diffusion equations requires careful validation

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Modular Architecture**: Design state management with clear boundaries and efficient data structures
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test with increasingly complex networks to identify performance bottlenecks early
3. **Mathematical Validation**: Implement test cases with known analytical solutions to validate numerical methods
