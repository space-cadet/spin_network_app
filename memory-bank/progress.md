## Current Status

The application now has a functional network data model with comprehensive UI-based operations for creating and editing networks. Users can create networks from templates (lattice, circular, random), add custom nodes by clicking on the canvas, connect nodes with edges, and delete elements. The property panel allows editing of node and edge properties.

We've enhanced the system to support dangling edges through placeholder nodes, which improves the network editing experience by allowing edges to persist when nodes are deleted. The visualization now uses fixed node sizing for better visual consistency and improved layout.

We've implemented state persistence so the network and UI state are preserved between page reloads or application restarts. We've also added undo/redo functionality, recent networks tracking, and hideable sidebars to improve the user experience.

The application now supports customizable node and edge types through a comprehensive type management system, allowing users to define and apply different visual styles to their network elements. The type-based styling is integrated with the main visualization through a custom hook that dynamically generates Cytoscape styles based on the types and view settings.

All TypeScript build errors have been fixed, and the codebase now complies with strict mode requirements. We've added comprehensive error handling and data validation to ensure a smooth user experience even when data corruption occurs.

## Known Issues

### UI/UX Issues
1. **Edge Creation Edge Cases**: Issues with creating edges between empty points
2. **Delete Mode Persistence**: Some issues with delete event handlers after network updates
3. **Resize Handle Positioning**: Resize handles can be difficult to target precisely
4. **Panel Size Coordination**: When resizing multiple panels, maintaining proportions can be challenging
5. **Recent Networks History**: Network history state is not consistently restored when loading from recent list
6. ~~**Panel Scrolling**: Long panels with collapsible sections may need improved scroll behavior~~ âœ“ FIXED
7. ~~**Settings Dropdown Visibility**: Dropdown not appearing when clicking Settings button~~ âœ“ FIXED

### Technical Issues
1. **Placeholder Node Behavior**: Some edge cases with placeholder node event handling
2. **Event Handler Persistence**: Challenges with maintaining event handlers across operations
3. **Edge Creation Workflow**: Need to refine the edge creation process for all scenarios
4. **Cytoscape.js Event Management**: Occasional event conflicts between different handlers
5. **History Serialization**: Complexity in properly saving and restoring complete history state
6. ~~**Type Data Corruption**: Issues with nodeTypes array becoming invalid~~ âœ“ FIXED

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **State Management Complexity**: Managing network state with undo/redo capability will be challenging
2. **Performance with Large Networks**: Visualization and manipulation performance may degrade with very large networks
3. **Complex Mathematics**: Implementing accurate numerical methods for diffusion equations requires careful validation

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Modular Architecture**: Design state management with clear boundaries and efficient data structures
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test with increasingly complex networks to identify performance bottlenecks early
3. **Mathematical Validation**: Implement test cases with known analytical solutions to validate numerical methods
4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Continue to improve error detection, reporting, and recovery
5. **Data Validation**: Add validation at all layers of the application to prevent data corruption
