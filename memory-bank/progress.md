## Current Status

The application now has a functional network data model with comprehensive UI-based operations for creating and editing networks. Users can create networks from templates (lattice, circular, random), add custom nodes by clicking on the canvas, connect nodes with edges, and delete elements. The property panel allows editing of node and edge properties.

We've enhanced the system to support dangling edges through placeholder nodes, which improves the network editing experience by allowing edges to persist when nodes are deleted. The visualization now uses fixed node sizing for better visual consistency and improved layout.

### Recent Achievements
1. Fixed node sizing issues to prevent nodes from expanding to fill the viewing area
2. Implemented support for dangling edges with placeholder node visualization
3. Enhanced node deletion to preserve connected edges as dangling edges
4. Added conversion of placeholder nodes to real nodes on demand
5. Implemented different styling for regular nodes, placeholder nodes, and dangling edges
6. Improved event handling for complex node/edge interactions

### In Progress
1. Addressing remaining edge creation issues (particularly creating edges between empty points)
2. Enhancing placeholder node interactions and behavior
3. Planning simulation engine development

## Known Issues

### UI/UX Issues
1. **Edge Creation Edge Cases**: Issues with creating edges between empty points
2. **Delete Mode Persistence**: Some issues with delete event handlers after network updates
3. **Resize Handle Positioning**: Resize handles can be difficult to target precisely
4. **Panel Size Coordination**: When resizing multiple panels, maintaining proportions can be challenging

### Technical Issues
1. **Placeholder Node Behavior**: Some edge cases with placeholder node event handling
2. **Event Handler Persistence**: Challenges with maintaining event handlers across operations
3. **Edge Creation Workflow**: Need to refine the edge creation process for all scenarios
4. **Cytoscape.js Event Management**: Occasional event conflicts between different handlers

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **State Management Complexity**: Managing network state with undo/redo capability will be challenging
2. **Performance with Large Networks**: Visualization and manipulation performance may degrade with very large networks
3. **Complex Mathematics**: Implementing accurate numerical methods for diffusion equations requires careful validation

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Modular Architecture**: Design state management with clear boundaries and efficient data structures
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test with increasingly complex networks to identify performance bottlenecks early
3. **Mathematical Validation**: Implement test cases with known analytical solutions to validate numerical methods
