## Current Status

The application now has a functional network data model with comprehensive UI-based operations for creating and editing networks. Users can create networks from templates (lattice, circular, random), add custom nodes by clicking on the canvas, connect nodes with edges, and delete elements. The property panel allows editing of node and edge properties.

We've implemented a complete set of interaction modes (select, pan, add node, add edge, delete) with visual feedback and intuitive toggling behavior. The application maintains a consistent state through Redux and provides immediate visual feedback for all operations.

### Recent Achievements
1. Implemented UI-based node creation on canvas click
2. Added edge creation through source/target node selection
3. Implemented element deletion with confirmation dialogs
4. Created mode-switching interface with visual feedback
5. Added status indicators for guiding users through operations
6. Fixed issues with Cytoscape.js integration and styling

### In Progress
1. Addressing edge cases in network operations
2. Planning simulation engine development
3. Designing matrix representations for diffusion

## Known Issues

### UI/UX Issues
1. **Edge Creation Edge Cases**: Some issues with the edge creation workflow in certain scenarios
2. **Delete Mode Persistence**: Issues with delete event handlers after network updates
3. **Resize Handle Positioning**: Resize handles can be difficult to target precisely
4. **Panel Size Coordination**: When resizing multiple panels, maintaining proportions can be challenging

### Technical Issues
1. **Cytoscape.js Styling Warnings**: Some styling warnings related to element mappings
2. **Event Handler Persistence**: Challenges with maintaining event handlers across operations
3. **Node Positioning**: Need to ensure consistent node positioning during view changes
4. **Selection Behavior**: Occasional issues with selection during mode transitions

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **State Management Complexity**: Managing network state with undo/redo capability will be challenging
2. **Performance with Large Networks**: Visualization and manipulation performance may degrade with very large networks
3. **Complex Mathematics**: Implementing accurate numerical methods for diffusion equations requires careful validation

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Modular Architecture**: Design state management with clear boundaries and efficient data structures
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test with increasingly complex networks to identify performance bottlenecks early
3. **Mathematical Validation**: Implement test cases with known analytical solutions to validate numerical methods
