## Current Work In Progress

### Phase 1: Core Network Functionality
- ðŸ”„ Planning the network data model implementation
- ðŸ”„ Designing network operations and manipulation tools
- ðŸ”„ Preparing for Redux state management integration

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1 (Highest Priority)
- â¬œ Network data model implementation
- â¬œ Network operations (create, edit, delete)
- â¬œ Template-based network generation
- â¬œ Redux state management integration

### Phase 2 (High Priority)
- â¬œ Undo/redo functionality
- â¬œ Spin network mathematics (Graph Laplacian)
- â¬œ Diffusion algorithm implementations
- â¬œ Numerical methods for time evolution
- â¬œ Initial data visualization components

### Phase 3 (Medium Priority)
- â¬œ Simulation control interface
- â¬œ Save/load functionality
- â¬œ UI refinements
- â¬œ User experience improvements
- â¬œ Dynamic network visualization during simulation
- â¬œ Energy conservation plots with actual data

### Additional Features (Lower Priority)

- â¬œ Dark/light theme support
- â¬œ Statistics and metrics calculation
- â¬œ Export functionality for results

## Current Status

The application has a functional user interface with interactive elements and proper layout. We are now transitioning from the initial UI development phase to implementing the core network functionality according to our revised development plan. This includes creating the network data model, implementing network operations, and setting up state management.

### Recent Achievements
1. Set up the project structure and tooling
2. Implemented the core UI components
3. Created a responsive layout with resizable panels
4. Added basic network visualization capability
5. Implemented interactive controls for the visualization
6. Developed a prioritized development plan

### In Progress
1. Designing the network data model with TypeScript interfaces
2. Planning network operations implementation
3. Preparing Redux state management architecture

## Known Issues

### UI/UX Issues
1. **Resize Handle Positioning**: Resize handles can be difficult to target precisely
2. **Panel Size Coordination**: When resizing multiple panels, maintaining proportions can be challenging
3. **Scroll Behavior**: Some panels may have scrolling issues with complex content

### Technical Issues
1. **Cytoscape Integration**: Network visualization needs proper sizing and event propagation
2. **Component Performance**: Some components may need optimization for complex networks
3. **Typescript Definitions**: Some type definitions need refinement

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **State Management Complexity**: Managing network state with undo/redo capability will be challenging
2. **Performance with Large Networks**: Visualization and manipulation performance may degrade with very large networks
3. **Complex Mathematics**: Implementing accurate numerical methods for diffusion equations requires careful validation

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Modular Architecture**: Design state management with clear boundaries and efficient data structures
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test with increasingly complex networks to identify performance bottlenecks early
3. **Mathematical Validation**: Implement test cases with known analytical solutions to validate numerical methods
