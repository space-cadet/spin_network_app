## Current Status

The application now has a functional network data model with comprehensive UI-based operations for creating and editing networks. Users can create networks from templates (lattice, circular, random), add custom nodes by clicking on the canvas, connect nodes with edges, and delete elements. The property panel allows editing of node and edge properties.

We've enhanced the system to support dangling edges through placeholder nodes, which improves the network editing experience by allowing edges to persist when nodes are deleted. The visualization now uses fixed node sizing for better visual consistency and improved layout.

We've implemented state persistence so the network and UI state are preserved between page reloads or application restarts. We've also added undo/redo functionality, recent networks tracking, and hideable sidebars to improve the user experience.

The application now supports customizable node and edge types through a comprehensive type management system, allowing users to define and apply different visual styles to their network elements. The type-based styling is integrated with the main visualization through a custom hook that dynamically generates Cytoscape styles based on the types and view settings.

We've recently enhanced the type management system to provide real-time updates with immediate visual feedback. Now when users modify type properties, the changes are instantly reflected in the visualization without requiring them to click an "Update" button. This creates a more intuitive and responsive experience.

We've also improved the UI organization by making all panels in both sidebars collapsible. The Type Management functionality is now available both as a modal through the Settings dropdown and as a collapsible panel in the right sidebar, giving users flexible access to this feature.

All TypeScript build errors have been fixed, and the codebase now complies with strict mode requirements. We've added comprehensive error handling and data validation to ensure a smooth user experience even when data corruption occurs.

2. **Incremental Testing**: Test with increasingly complex networks to identify performance bottlenecks early
3. **Mathematical Validation**: Implement test cases with known analytical solutions to validate numerical methods
4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Continue to improve error detection, reporting, and recovery
5. **Data Validation**: Add validation at all layers of the application to prevent data corruption
