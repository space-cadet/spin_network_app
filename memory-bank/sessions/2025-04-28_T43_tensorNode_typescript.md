*Date: 2025-04-28*
*Task: T43*

## Session Overview
Converted tensorNode.js to TypeScript implementation, leveraging existing type definitions from core/tensor.ts.

## Changes Made
1. Created new tensorNode.ts file
2. Updated type imports from core/tensor.ts
3. Fixed type references and implementations
4. Preserved old JS file as reference

## Technical Details
- Used TensorNode interface from core/tensor.ts
- Removed duplicate type definitions
- Updated function signatures with proper types
- Maintained existing functionality

## Files Modified
- Created: `/lib/tensor/tensorNode.ts`
- Renamed: `/lib/tensor/tensorNode.js` to `.old`

## Notes
- Successfully maintained compatibility with existing tensor implementations
- No changes to underlying functionality
- Improved type safety and consistency
