# Session: T46 - Implement state persistence for documentation and testing pages
*Last Updated: 2025-05-01 09:42*

**Task:** Implement Redux-based state persistence for documentation and testing pages to maintain state across page reloads and navigation.

**Date:** 2025-05-01

**Summary:**
This session focused on implementing state persistence for the documentation and testing pages using Redux and Redux Persist. The goal was to ensure that the selected resource on these pages is remembered even after a page reload or when navigating away and back.

**Implementation Details:**
- Created a new Redux slice `testingSlice.ts` to manage the selected resource ID for the testing page.
- Modified `store/index.ts` to include the new testing slice and configure persistence for both documentation and testing slices.
- Modified `components/testing/TestingPage.tsx` and `components/documentation/DocsPage.tsx` to use Redux for state management.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/store/slices/testingSlice.ts`
- `src/store/index.ts`
- `src/components/testing/TestingPage.tsx`
- `src/components/documentation/DocsPage.tsx`

**Status:** COMPLETED
