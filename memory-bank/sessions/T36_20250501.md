## Active Tasks
### T36: Enhance Tensor Test Output
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Progress**:
1. ‚úÖ Added detailed output for 2-valent nodes showing:
   - Spin values j‚ÇÅ and j‚ÇÇ
   - Tensor dimensions
   - Element-by-element identity tensor verification
   - Zero tensor verification for mismatched spins
2. ‚úÖ Added detailed output for 3-valent nodes showing:
   - All three spin values
   - Triangle inequality checks
   - Intertwiner dimension
   - All non-zero tensor elements
3. ‚úÖ Added detailed output for 4-valent nodes showing:
   - All four spin values
   - Intermediate coupling j
   - Allowed intermediate spin ranges
   - Intertwiner space dimension
   - Non-zero tensor elements
   - Tensor normalization verification

## Context and Working State
- Enhanced tensor-tests.html with more detailed test output
- Added verification of mathematical properties
- Implemented element-by-element tensor checks
- Added validation of physical constraints (triangle inequalities)

## Critical Files
- `/docs/implementation/tensor-tests.html`: Enhanced test output implementation
- `/lib/quantum/tensorOperations.ts`: Core tensor operations
- `/lib/core/intertwinerSpace.ts`: Intertwiner space calculations

## Session Notes
- Improved test output provides better validation of tensor implementation
- Added normalization checks to verify quantum state properties
- Enhanced visibility of physical constraints like triangle inequalities
