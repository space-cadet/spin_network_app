# Session: T56 - Quantum Library Code Reorganization
*Date: 2025-05-05 23:00 IST*

## Context
Implementing comprehensive test suite for core quantum modules following validation utilities consolidation.

## Changes Made
- Created comprehensive test files in lib/quantum/__tests__/:
  - measurement.test.ts
  - densityMatrix.test.ts
  - gates.test.ts
  - composition.test.ts
  - matrixOperations.test.ts
  - stateVector.test.ts
  - operator.test.ts

## Test Coverage
1. Measurement Tests:
   - Projection operators
   - Expectation values
   - Measurement outcomes

2. Density Matrix Tests:
   - Pure/mixed states
   - Quantum channels
   - Entanglement measures

3. Gates Tests:
   - Single-qubit gates
   - Multi-qubit gates
   - Gate properties

4. Other Core Components:
   - State vectors
   - Operators
   - Matrix operations
   - Quantum composition

## Progress
- ✅ Created all core test files
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Added edge case testing
- ✅ Added numerical precision checks

## Next Steps
1. Move tensor operations to operations/
2. Update remaining documentation
3. Ensure all tests pass integration

## Notes
- Tests include property validation and edge cases
- Added numerical precision checks where needed
- Test structure follows project patterns
