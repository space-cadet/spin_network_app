*Date: 2025-05-05*
*Start Time: 17:00 IST*
*End Time: 17:30 IST*

## Session Overview
Initial implementation of quantum library core components focusing on Phase 1 (Core Quantum Foundations).

## Implementation Steps
1. Created new quantum library structure following reorganized plan
2. Implemented core types in types.ts:
   - Complex interface with real/imaginary parts
   - StateVector interface with dimension and amplitudes
   - Operator interface with core quantum operations
   - MeasurementOutcome interface for quantum measurements

3. Implemented enhanced complex operations in complex.ts:
   - Required operations: subtract, conjugate, modulus
   - Added isZeroComplex with configurable tolerance
   - Additional utilities: divide, phase, polar form

4. Implemented base operator framework in operator.ts:
   - MatrixOperator class with full implementation
   - Type validation for unitary/hermitian/projection
   - Core operations: apply, compose, adjoint
   - Utility functions for common operators

## Next Steps
1. Implement Hamiltonian class
2. Add matrix operations support
3. Set up test infrastructure

## Technical Notes
- Focused on making quantum module self-contained
- Enhanced complex operations for numerical stability
- Added comprehensive type validation
- Prepared foundation for quantum simulation features

## Session Outcome
✅ Successfully implemented core quantum types and operations
✅ Set up modular structure for quantum library
✅ Created foundation for further quantum features

## Files Modified
- Created lib/quantum/types.ts
- Created lib/quantum/complex.ts
- Created lib/quantum/operator.ts
- Updated standalone-lib-quantum-plan.md with new structure
