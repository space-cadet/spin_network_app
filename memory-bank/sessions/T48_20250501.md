## Session Focus
Implementing shared test infrastructure and beginning React-specific tests migration.

## Changes Made
1. Implemented shared test infrastructure modules:
   - Created testRunner.js with test registration and execution
   - Created testLogger.js for unified logging
   - Created uiElements.js for consistent UI components
   - Created visualizer.js for tensor/network visualization

2. Created React tensor operations test:
   - Set up basic HTML structure
   - Added test control panel
   - Implemented tensor visualization
   - Added test suite for 2, 3, and 4-valent nodes

## Working Files
- `/test-reorganization/scripts/modules/testRunner.js`
- `/test-reorganization/scripts/modules/testLogger.js`
- `/test-reorganization/scripts/modules/uiElements.js`
- `/test-reorganization/scripts/modules/visualizer.js`
- `/test-reorganization/tests/react-app/tensor-operations.html`

## Notes
- Successfully completed Phase 1 (shared infrastructure)
- Started Phase 2 with tensor operations test implementation
- Infrastructure supports both React and standalone contexts
- Added proper styling and visualization capabilities

## Next Steps
1. Complete tensor operations test implementation
2. Begin simulation methods test implementation
3. Validate React-specific tests
4. Begin standalone test migration
