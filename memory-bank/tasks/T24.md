## Task Information
**Title:** Enhance Log Explorer with State Persistence and Sorting
**Description**: Enhance the log explorer component to persist state between page reloads and navigation events, and add advanced file display options including detailed file information and sorting capabilities.
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Started**: April 19, 2025
**Last Active**: April 19, 2025 (19:30 IST)
**Completed**: April 20, 2025 (11:00 IST)
**Dependencies**: T22
**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ Create Redux slice for log explorer state persistence (`logExplorerSlice.ts`)
- ✅ Integrate slice into main store with persistence (`store/index.ts`)
- ✅ Replace `useState` with Redux for `currentPath`, `selectedFile`, `splitPosition` in `FileExplorer.tsx`
- ✅ Update event handlers in `FileExplorer.tsx` to dispatch Redux actions
- ✅ Enhance `FileItem` interface with `createdAt` and `type`
- ✅ Update `loadFiles` to populate `createdAt` and `type`
- ✅ Update `loadFiles` to call `sortFiles` 
- ✅ Implement full sorting logic in `sortFiles` function (using Redux state)
- ✅ Add sorting UI (clickable headers, indicators)
- ✅ Fix TypeScript errors related to sorting and `fs.readFile` signature
- ✅ Fix DOM nesting warning related to `<tbody>` whitespace
- ✅ Add Details/Content view toggle UI and logic
- ✅ Update file list rendering based on `viewMode`
- ✅ Add formatted content display for CSV files using PapaParse
- ✅ Add formatted content display for JSON files using react-json-tree
- ✅ Implement state persistence using Redux Persist

- `/src/store/slices/` (new logExplorerSlice.ts to be created)
- `/src/store/index.ts` (for redux-persist configuration)

**Notes**:
This enhancement will improve the user experience by maintaining the log explorer state across page reloads and navigation events. Users will be able to return to the same folder and file they were previously viewing. The addition of detailed file information and sorting capabilities will make it easier to manage and navigate log files, particularly as the number of log files grows. This builds upon the existing log explorer implementation (T22) to provide a more complete and user-friendly file management experience.
