**Notes**:
Made significant progress by implementing comprehensive I/O and serialization components. The implementation includes serialization for simulation state, graph, and parameters; multiple storage adapters (memory, localStorage, IndexedDB, BrowserFS, NodeFS); export functionality in various formats (JSON, CSV, JSONL); import functionality with validation; and a high-level SimulationStorage API for managing simulations. These additions address one of the major gaps identified in the feature comparison with the React app.
Made significant progress on the library implementation. Completed the core components including state vector, graph, simulation engine, diffusion models, and numerical solvers. The library is now in a usable state for basic simulations, with a functioning API that allows creating graphs, setting up initial conditions, choosing diffusion models and solvers, and running simulations. Still need to implement some advanced features like analysis tools, visualization adapters, and specialized weight functions, but the core functionality is in place.
