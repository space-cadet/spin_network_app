*Created: May 29, 2025 23:00 IST*
*Last Updated: May 29, 2025 23:00 IST*

## Task Description
Implement a dual rendering system that allows users to switch between 2D (Sigma.js) and 3D (React Three Fiber) visualization modes for graph rendering in the graph-test-app. This provides users with both traditional 2D network visualization and immersive 3D spatial graph exploration capabilities.

## Objectives
1. Add renderer mode selection to Redux state management
2. Create separate renderer components for 2D and 3D visualization
3. Implement unified graph instance management across both renderers  
4. Add UI controls for switching between rendering modes
5. Ensure seamless data flow between graph builders and both renderers
6. Maintain backward compatibility with existing Sigma.js functionality

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Add `renderMode: '2d' | '3d'` to Redux graphSlice state
- ✅ Add `setRenderMode` action for mode switching
- ✅ Add Three.js dependencies (@react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, three)
- ✅ Create renderers directory structure

### Phase 2: Renderer Components ✅ COMPLETE  
- ✅ Create SigmaRenderer component (migrated from GraphManager)
- ✅ Create ThreeFiberRenderer component with Three.js/React Three Fiber
- ✅ Implement unified graph instance management (setCurrentGraphInstance)
- ✅ Create proper 3D node rendering (spheres with SphereGeometry)
- ✅ Create proper 3D edge rendering (cylinders with CylinderGeometry)
- ✅ Add 3D lighting and camera controls (OrbitControls)

### Phase 3: UI Integration ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Update GraphCanvas to conditionally render based on renderMode
- ✅ Create RendererSelector component with 2D/3D toggle buttons
- ✅ Add RendererSelector to ControlPanel
- ✅ Update GraphBuilderControls to use unified graph instance management

### Phase 4: Coordinate System Enhancement ⬜ PENDING
- ⬜ Enhance 3D coordinate generation (currently using random Z-coordinates)
- ⬜ Implement proper 3D layouts for different graph types
- ⬜ Add Z-coordinate support to graph builders
- ⬜ Create 3D-specific graph types (sphere layout, 3D lattices)

### Phase 5: Advanced 3D Features ⬜ PENDING
- ⬜ Add node/edge selection in 3D (raycasting)
- ⬜ Implement 3D-specific interactions (hover, click events)
- ⬜ Add 3D camera controls and presets
- ⬜ Implement 3D animation and transitions
- ⬜ Add 3D-specific styling options

## Current Status: Phase 3 Complete

**Achievement**: Successfully implemented complete dual rendering system with:

1. **Functional 2D/3D Switching**: Users can toggle between Sigma.js 2D and Three.js 3D rendering
2. **Unified Data Flow**: Both renderers share the same graph data from GraphBuilderControls
3. **Complete UI Integration**: Professional renderer selector with visual feedback
4. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing Sigma.js functionality preserved
5. **3D Visualization**: Functional 3D graph rendering with proper nodes, edges, and controls

**Technical Implementation**:
- Redux state management for renderer mode selection
- Modular renderer architecture with clean separation of concerns
- Unified graph instance management across both rendering systems
- React Three Fiber integration with OrbitControls and proper 3D scene setup
- Professional UI controls with visual mode indicators

## Dependencies
- T64a: @spin-network/graph-core Package (for graph data structures)
- T64c: graph-ui Package (for visualization components)

## Files
- `packages/graph-test-app/src/store/graphSlice.ts` - Redux state with renderMode
- `packages/graph-test-app/src/components/graph/renderers/` - Renderer components
  - `SigmaRenderer.tsx` - 2D Sigma.js renderer
  - `ThreeFiberRenderer.tsx` - 3D Three.js renderer  
  - `index.ts` - Unified exports and graph instance management
- `packages/graph-test-app/src/components/panels/RendererSelector.tsx` - Mode selection UI
- `packages/graph-test-app/src/components/graph/GraphCanvas.tsx` - Updated renderer selector
- `packages/graph-test-app/package.json` - Three.js dependencies

## Priority
HIGH - Enhances user experience with modern 3D visualization capabilities while maintaining existing 2D functionality

## Notes
This implementation provides a solid foundation for 3D graph visualization while preserving all existing 2D capabilities. The modular architecture allows for easy extension of either rendering system without affecting the other. Future enhancements can focus on improving 3D layouts, interactions, and visual effects.

## Next Steps
1. Enhance 3D coordinate generation for better spatial layouts
2. Add 3D-specific graph types and layouts
3. Implement 3D interaction capabilities (selection, hover, etc.)
4. Add advanced camera controls and scene management
5. Consider performance optimizations for large graphs in 3D
