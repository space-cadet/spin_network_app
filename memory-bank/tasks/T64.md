**Description**: Redesign and restructure the library to create proper abstract graph tools that integrate with quantum module for building graph state vectors with quantum states on edges and intertwiner tensors on nodes.

**Status**: ⬜ **Last**: 2025-05-11 20:30 IST

**Priority**: HIGH

## Objectives

1. Create a consistent package structure with all library code in packages/
2. Develop abstract graph tools independent of simulation specifics

## Files

### New Package Structure
- `packages/quantum/` - Migrated quantum mechanics core
- `packages/graph-core/` - Abstract graph structures
- `packages/tensor-core/` - Tensor operations
- `packages/spin-network/` - Integration of quantum, graph, and tensor

### Documentation Files
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/graph-quantum-integration-plan.md` - Detailed implementation plan

## Dependencies
- T56 (Quantum Library Code Reorganization)
- T55 (Enhance Quantum Features of Standalone Library)

## Notes
This task implements a complete restructuring of the library to properly separate abstract graph structures from quantum-specific functionality while enabling their seamless integration. The implementation plan in memory-bank/implementation-details/graph-quantum-integration-plan.md provides a detailed blueprint for this restructuring.

The approach addresses several key issues with the current implementation:
1. Naming that doesn't reflect abstract graph structures
2. Tight coupling between graph structure and simulation-specific concepts
3. Incomplete tensor implementation for intertwiner spaces
4. No clear separation between abstract graph structures and quantum-specific extensions
5. Inconsistent organization with code spread across lib/ and packages/

By moving all library code to packages/ and creating proper abstractions, this restructuring will result in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase with clear boundaries between components.
