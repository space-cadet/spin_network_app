# T64: Graph-Quantum Integration Restructuring

**Description**: Redesign and restructure the library to create proper abstract graph tools that integrate with quantum module for building graph state vectors with quantum states on edges and intertwiner tensors on nodes.

**Status**: 🔄 **Last**: 2025-05-12 22:30 IST

**Priority**: HIGH

## Objectives

1. Create a consistent package structure with all library code in packages/
2. Develop abstract graph tools independent of simulation specifics
3. Implement quantum edge states and intertwiner node tensors
4. Create a composition framework to build quantum graph states

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Package Structure and Quantum Migration
- ✅ Create packages/quantum directory structure
- ✅ Move and reorganize lib/quantum code to packages/quantum
- ✅ Create proper package.json, tsconfig.json and build configurations

- ⬜ Ensure tests are migrated and passing

### Phase 2: Abstract Graph Implementation
- ⬜ Create packages/graph-core directory structure
- ⬜ Implement core AbstractGraph class and interfaces
- ⬜ Create graph algorithms and utility functions
- ⬜ Implement comprehensive tests

### Phase 3: Tensor Core Implementation

### Phase 4: Spin Network Integration
- ⬜ Create packages/spin-network directory structure
- ⬜ Implement EdgeStateVector for quantum states on edges
- ⬜ Create IntertwinerNode implementation
- ⬜ Build GraphStateComposer for state composition

### Phase 5: Documentation and Examples
- ⬜ Create comprehensive documentation
- ⬜ Build educational examples
- ⬜ Create migration guides
- ⬜ Update existing documentation

## Files

### New Package Structure
- `packages/quantum/` - Migrated quantum mechanics core
- `packages/graph-core/` - Abstract graph structures
- `packages/tensor-core/` - Tensor operations
- `packages/spin-network/` - Integration of quantum, graph, and tensor

### Documentation Files
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/graph-quantum-integration-plan.md` - Detailed implementation plan

## Dependencies
- T56 (Quantum Library Code Reorganization)
- T55 (Enhance Quantum Features of Standalone Library)

## Notes
This task implements a complete restructuring of the library to properly separate abstract graph structures from quantum-specific functionality while enabling their seamless integration. The implementation plan in memory-bank/implementation-details/graph-quantum-integration-plan.md provides a detailed blueprint for this restructuring.

The approach addresses several key issues with the current implementation:
1. Naming that doesn't reflect abstract graph structures
2. Tight coupling between graph structure and simulation-specific concepts
3. Incomplete tensor implementation for intertwiner spaces
4. No clear separation between abstract graph structures and quantum-specific extensions
5. Inconsistent organization with code spread across lib/ and packages/

By moving all library code to packages/ and creating proper abstractions, this restructuring will result in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase with clear boundaries between components.
