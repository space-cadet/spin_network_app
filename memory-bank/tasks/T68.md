   - Implement harmonic oscillator state creation and manipulation
   - Show ladder operator algebra
   - Demonstrate energy eigenstate calculations

**Implementation**:
- Create `/packages/quantum/examples/papers/` directory
- Implement simple, well-documented examples
- Focus on clear demonstrations rather than complex calculations
- Each example should be self-contained and runnable

### Phase 2: Spin Network Applications (Medium Complexity)
