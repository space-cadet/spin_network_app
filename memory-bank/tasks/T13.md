## Task Information
**Title:** Standalone Library Feature Analysis
**Description**: Perform comparative analysis of the React App, standalone library, standalone-test.js, and test-simulation.js to identify feature gaps and create a plan for implementing missing features in the standalone library.
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: April 16, 2025
**Last Active**: April 16, 2025
**Completed**: April 16, 2025
**Dependencies**: T1
**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ Analyze core features in all four components

**Notes**:
Completed a thorough comparative analysis of all spin network components. Created a feature comparison table that highlights which features exist in each component. Generated an enhancement plan focusing on core simulation capabilities, analysis tools, visualization adapters, utilities, and I/O operations. Created an architecture diagram showing the modular structure for the standalone library. This analysis will inform future development of the standalone library to ensure it contains all necessary features while remaining framework-agnostic.
