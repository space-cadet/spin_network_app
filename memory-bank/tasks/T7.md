## Task Information
**Title:** Implement Memory Bank File Rotation
**Description**: Implement the file rotation system for Memory Bank files that have grown too large, starting with errorLog.md. This follows the size-based rotation protocol specified in the Integrated Code Rules.
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Last Active**: April 15, 2025 (09:10 IST)
**Completion Criteria**:
- Create archive directory if it doesn't exist
- Implement rotation for errorLog.md with preservation of recent entries
- Establish naming convention for archived files
- Minimize token usage by using efficient commands
- Document rotation process
- Update edit_history.md to reflect the changes

**Related Files**:
- `/memory-bank/errorLog.md`
- `/memory-bank/archive/errorLog_2025-04.md`
- `/memory-bank/edit_history.md`
- `/memory-bank/tasks.md`

**Notes**:
Used an efficient approach that preserved the most recent 5 error entries while archiving the rest. Used command-line tools to minimize token usage and avoid loading the entire large file. This implementation satisfies the Memory Bank Size Management Protocol from Section 3.6 of the Integrated Code Rules.
