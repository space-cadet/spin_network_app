## Task Information
**Title:** Fix Logging File Paths and Structure
**Description**: Fix log file paths to ensure logs are written to the correct locations. Create missing directories and update simulationLogger classes to use this directory structure correctly.
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Started**: April 17, 2025
**Last Active**: April 18, 2025 (12:45 IST)
**Completed**: April 18, 2025 (12:45 IST)
**Dependencies**: -
**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ Design appropriate folder structure for different log types
- ✅ Evaluate current logging structure and folder organization
- ✅ Create missing /logs/simulation/tests directory for test logs
- ✅ Ensure application logs go to /logs/application folder
- ✅ Update simulationLogger.ts to log graph operations to /logs/simulation/graphs
- ✅ Fix test log files to write to /logs/simulation/tests instead of /logs/simulation/sessions
- ✅ Update simulation logger classes to use the correct paths
- ✅ Fix paths for simulation logs to go to /logs/simulation/runs
- ✅ Create .gitkeep files to ensure empty directories are tracked
- ✅ Create a .gitignore file to ignore log files but track directory structure
- ✅ Create a README.md with documentation about the log structure
- ✅ Add rotation policies to manage log file sizes

**Related Files**:
- `/logs` (directory structure)
- `/lib/utils/simulationLogger.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/simulationLogger.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/graph.ts`
- `/src/utils/browserFSConfig.ts`
- `/src/main.tsx`

**Notes**:
Successfully fixed the log file paths to ensure logs are written to the correct locations. Modified the simulationLogger classes to use the proper paths, specifically ensuring that graph creation events are logged to `/logs/simulation/graphs` and simulation events are logged to `/logs/simulation/runs`. Added extra logging and directory creation steps to ensure all required directories exist. Enhanced the initialization process to create the complete directory structure on startup. Future improvements should include adding .gitkeep files, creating a README.md for the log structure, and implementing rotation policies.
