**Notes**:
Intertwiner spaces represent the SU(2)-invariant subspaces at nodes in spin networks. The dimension and basis of these spaces are crucial for quantum spin network calculations. 

Made significant progress with:
1. Comprehensive documentation explaining the order dependence in intertwiner calculations
2. Mathematical formulation of different recoupling schemes and their physical meaning
3. Detailed examples showing how different orderings of the same spins can yield different dimensions
4. Implementation of permutation-invariant functions in Python to ensure consistent results
5. Complete reorganization of the documentation with a logical flow and table of contents
6. Fixed critical bug in the `allowed_intermediate_spins()` function that was causing incorrect dimension calculations
7. Added detailed intertwiner spaces section to physics-notebook.html with proper mathematical notation
8. Incorporated information from error log about the bug fix into documentation

The bug fix ensures that the implementation properly enforces the quantum mechanical selection rules for angular momentum coupling:
- When coupling two integer spins, intermediate spins must be integers
- When coupling two half-integer spins, intermediate spins must be integers
- When coupling an integer and half-integer spin, intermediate spins must be half-integers

This fixed the case of `intertwiner_dimension(1, 0.5, 0.5, 1)` which now correctly returns 2 instead of 3, ensuring that all dimension calculations follow proper angular momentum physics.
