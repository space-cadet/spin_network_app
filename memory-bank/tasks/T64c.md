## Task Description
Create a dedicated graph-ui package to house all graph visualization and interaction components, separating UI concerns from core graph operations. This package will provide reusable React components for graph visualization, manipulation, and control.

## Objectives
1. Set up graph-ui package structure and configuration
2. Migrate and improve graph visualization components from graph-test-app
3. Create comprehensive component library for graph interaction
4. Implement proper state management and hooks
5. Add thorough testing and documentation

## Dependencies
