## Context
This task addresses the memory scaling limitations discovered in T73a toric code examples. Tensor networks provide exponential memory savings for structured quantum states, enabling efficient computation of larger quantum systems while maintaining full compatibility with existing quantum graph, StateVector, and operator infrastructure.

## Progress
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Core tensor infrastructure leveraging existing matrix operations
- [ ] **Phase 2**: IQuantumState implementation with StateVector compatibility
- [ ] **Phase 3**: QuantumGraph integration using existing conversion patterns
- [ ] **Phase 4**: IOperator implementation with existing gate integration
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Specialized networks building on existing T73a examples
- [ ] **Phase 6**: Testing using existing infrastructure and validation patterns

## Notes
**Design Philosophy**: Enhance rather than replace existing infrastructure. Full compatibility with IQuantumState/IOperator interfaces. Build directly on existing QuantumGraph, StateVector, and graph-core modules. Reuse 100% of existing test patterns and validation utilities.
