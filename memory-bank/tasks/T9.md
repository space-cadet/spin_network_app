## Task Information
**Title:** Fix UI and Simulation TypeScript Errors
**Description**: Fix TypeScript errors in UI components, hooks, and simulation code that are preventing the application from building successfully. This complements the database service error fixes in task T6.
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Last Active**: April 15, 2025 (15:30 IST)
**Completion Criteria**:
- Fix error handling in App.tsx and logMigrationUtil.ts (unknown type issues)
- Fix prop type mismatches in LogViewerAdapter.tsx
- Fix Tag component prop type errors in LogViewerAdapter
- Fix AsyncThunkAction type issues in LogViewerAdapter
- Resolve property accesses on empty objects in SimulationResultsPanel.tsx
- Fix type compatibility issues in state objects in SimulationResultsPanel.tsx
- Fix null safety issues in engineImplementation.ts 
- Resolve missing type definitions in useSimulation.ts
- Fix the hasWarnedNull property issues in useSimulation.ts
- Check each fix with TypeScript to ensure compatibility
- Validate that all fixes maintain existing functionality
- Ensure build completes successfully after fixes are applied

- `/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/engineImplementation.ts`
- `/src/store/slices/logsSlice.ts`
- `/src/utils/logMigrationUtil.ts`
- `/src/database/services/simulationService.ts`

**Notes**:
Made significant progress in fixing TypeScript errors by addressing several critical issues:
1. Fixed SimulationParameters type compatibility in useSimulation.ts by implementing proper type assertions
2. Added null safety checks in engineImplementation.ts to handle potentially null objects
3. Ensured boolean type consistency in SimulationResultsPanel.tsx
4. Fixed void/number comparison in simulationService.ts

Some TypeScript errors still remain to be fixed. The incremental approach allows us to validate each fix individually while making steady progress toward a successful build.
