## Task Information
**Title:** Fix Documentation Rendering and Interaction Issues
**Description**: Fix the rendering and interactive functionality issues in the documentation system. Address Markdown formatting, script loading, module imports, and navigation problems.
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: April 21, 2025
**Last Active**: April 21, 2025 (18:15 IST)
**Dependencies**: T28
**Completion Criteria**:
- â¬œ Fix Markdown header ID anchors that display as `{#anchor-name}` in the rendered output
- âœ… Fix script loading in standalone-guide.html to make interactive controls work
- ðŸ”„ Resolve simulation module loading in simulation-test.html
- âœ… Implement proper routing to handle page refreshes and back navigation
- ðŸ”„ Create a consistent module loading strategy for documentation scripts
- â¬œ Bundle required UMD libraries to correct location for both dev and production
- âœ… Update iframe implementation to better handle script resources
- âœ… Add improved error handling for missing dependencies
- â¬œ Test and verify all fixes in both development and production environments

- `/vite.config.ts`
- `/lib-bundle.config.js`
- `/src/main.tsx` (for routing)
- `/public/_redirects` (for SPA routing)

**Notes**:
The documentation system has been organized with a standardized structure, and significant progress has been made on fixing rendering and functionality issues:

1. âœ… FIXED: Script loading in standalone-guide.html by updating the UMD library path from absolute to relative
2. âœ… FIXED: Page refresh navigation issues by adding proper SPA redirects
3. âœ… FIXED: HTML content processing in DocsViewer with better base path handling
4. ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS: Simplified simulation-test.html to use global window.SpinNetwork object

Two major improvements have been implemented today:

**Path Fix in standalone-guide.html**: 
Updated the UMD library script path from `/dist/lib/spin-network.umd.js` to `../../dist/lib/spin-network.umd.js`, which correctly resolves the library location relative to the document. This fixes the script loading failures in the standalone guide.

**SPA Navigation Fix**:
Added `public/_redirects` configuration with the rule `/*    /index.html   200` that handles SPA routing properly. This prevents 404 errors when refreshing documentation pages and allows proper back/forward navigation.

Remaining focus areas:
1. Fixing Markdown header ID anchors that still display as literal text
2. Bundling required UMD libraries to the correct locations
3. Testing all fixes in both development and production environments
