## Task Information
**Title:** Fix Node/Edge Property Updates
**Description**: Fix issue where changes to node and edge properties via Settings or the Type Management panel require a page refresh before being applied to the visualization.
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Started**: April 20, 2025
**Last Active**: April 20, 2025 (16:30 IST)
**Completed**: April 20, 2025 (18:45 IST)
**Dependencies**: -
**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ Identify root cause of property updates not being applied without page refresh
- ✅ Fix the `useCytoscapeInstance` hook to update styles when they change
- ✅ Verify changes work for both Settings dropdown menu changes
- ✅ Verify changes work for Type Management panel updates
- ✅ Test changes with different property types (size, color, border, etc.)
- ✅ Document solution in appropriate files

**Related Files**:

- `/src/hooks/useTypeBasedStyles.ts`
- `/src/components/settings/types/NodeTypeManager.tsx`
- `/src/components/settings/types/EdgeTypeManager.tsx`
- `/src/store/slices/typeSlice.ts`

**Notes**:
The issue was identified in the `useCytoscapeInstance` hook, which initializes the Cytoscape instance with styles when it's created but doesn't update those styles when they change. This means that when node or edge properties are modified via Settings or the Type Management panel, the Redux store is updated correctly, but those changes aren't reflected in the Cytoscape instance until a page refresh forces a reinstantiation of the component. Adding a `useEffect` hook with a dependency on `styles` should fix this issue by applying the updated styles to the Cytoscape instance whenever they change.
