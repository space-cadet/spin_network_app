# Task T66: Multi-Spin Coupling and Intertwiner Implementation
*Created: 2025-05-24*
*Last Updated: 2025-05-24*

## Task Information
**Title:** Multi-Spin Coupling and Intertwiner Implementation for Spin Networks
**Status:** ⬜ CREATED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** Not started
**Dependencies:** T55a (Angular Momentum Algebra)

## Description
Implement multi-spin coupling capabilities and intertwiner calculations to enable construction of quantum states for spin network vertices with multiple incident edges. This extends the current angular momentum algebra (T55a) to handle sequential coupling of 3+ spins and automatic intertwiner space computation.

## Background and Research Findings
During analysis of current quantum model capabilities for tetrahedron construction, we discovered that the existing `addAngularMomenta()` function only handles two-spin coupling. Systematic testing revealed:

### Current Capabilities (Working):
- **Two-spin coupling**: Perfect functionality via existing `addAngularMomenta(state1, j1, state2, j2)`
- **Individual spin states**: `createJmState(j, m)` works for all j values including j=1/2
- **Clebsch-Gordan coefficients**: Full implementation with caching
- **Manual multi-spin analysis**: All valid coupling coefficients can be calculated by hand

### Current Limitations (Failing):
- **Sequential coupling beyond 2 spins**: Fails because `addAngularMomenta()` expects specific dimensions
- **Composite state handling**: No way to determine effective angular momentum j of coupled states
- **Automatic intertwiner calculation**: Cannot compute allowed J values for n-valent vertices

### Test Results Summary
Created comprehensive test prototype `packages/quantum/examples/angularMomentum/multi-spin-demo.ts` with findings:
- **Two-spin test**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Three-spin sequential**: ❌ FAILED (dimension mismatch error)
- **Three-spin manual**: ✅ SUCCESS (shows all valid coupling coefficients)
- **Four-spin test**: ❌ FAILED (same dimension issue)

**Key Error**: `"State 1 dimension 4 does not match angular momentum j1=1 (expected 3)"`

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause
The issue occurs because after coupling two j=1/2 spins, the result is a 4-dimensional composite state containing both j=0 and j=1 components. The current `addAngularMomenta()` function cannot handle composite states - it expects pure angular momentum eigenstates with dimension `2j+1`.

### Mathematical Foundation
The manual coefficient calculation (Test 3 in demo) proves that all required mathematics exist:
- Generated 18 valid three-spin coupling coefficients
- Covered all j12 intermediate values (0, 1)  
- Covered all final J values (1/2, 3/2)
- All coefficients match expected quantum mechanical values

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: State Decomposition (Foundation)
**Goal**: Enable analysis of composite angular momentum states

**Components**:
1. **State Analyzer**:
   ```typescript
   function analyzeAngularState(state: StateVector): AngularStateAnalysis
   interface AngularStateAnalysis {
     components: Map<number, {amplitude: Complex, dimension: number}>
     dominantJ: number
     mixedState: boolean
   }
   ```

2. **J-Component Extractor**:
   ```typescript
   function extractJComponent(state: StateVector, targetJ: number): StateVector | null
   ```

### Phase 2: Multi-Spin Coupling (Core Functionality)  
**Goal**: Automate the manual process from Test 3

**Components**:
1. **Three-Spin Coupler**:
   ```typescript
   function coupleThreeSpins(
     state1: StateVector, j1: number,
     state2: StateVector, j2: number, 
     state3: StateVector, j3: number
   ): StateVector
   ```

2. **N-Spin Coupler** (generalization):
   ```typescript
   function coupleMultipleSpins(
     states: StateVector[], 
     j_values: number[], 
     couplingScheme?: string
   ): StateVector
   ```

### Phase 3: Intertwiner Spaces (Network Integration)
**Goal**: Calculate allowed angular momentum values for network vertices

**Components**:
1. **Intertwiner Space Calculator**:
   ```typescript
   function calculateIntertwiners(edgeSpins: number[]): IntertwinerSpace[]
   interface IntertwinerSpace {
     J: number
     multiplicity: number  
     basisStates: StateVector[]
   }
   ```

2. **Network Integration**:
   ```typescript
   function createQuantumVertex(edgeSpins: number[], intertwiners: IntertwinerSpace[]): QuantumVertex
   function validateSpinNetwork(network: SpinNetwork): boolean
   ```
