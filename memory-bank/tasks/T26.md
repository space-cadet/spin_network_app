## Task Information
**Title:** Fix BrowserFS in Vercel Deployment
**Description**: Fix the BrowserFS loading issue in Vercel deployment. Currently, BrowserFS works locally but fails on Vercel with a 404 error when trying to load from node_modules.
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: April 20, 2025
**Last Active**: April 20, 2025 (12:15 IST)
**Completed**: April 20, 2025 (15:30 IST)
**Dependencies**: -
**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ Identify root cause of BrowserFS loading failure in Vercel environment
- ✅ Implement solution to load BrowserFS from public directory instead of node_modules
- ✅ Add automatic copying of BrowserFS script during build process
- ✅ Implement CDN fallback mechanism for improved reliability
- ✅ Add enhanced error logging for easier troubleshooting
- ✅ Verify fix works correctly in Vercel deployment
- ✅ Document solution for future reference

**Related Files**:
- `/src/utils/browserFSConfig.ts`
- `/package.json`
- `/public/vendor/browserfs.min.js`
- `/src/main.tsx`

**Notes**:
The issue was caused by the BrowserFS script being loaded from `/node_modules/browserfs/dist/browserfs.min.js`, which works in local development but fails in production builds since node_modules is not deployed to Vercel. The solution involves copying the script to the public directory, updating the script path in browserFSConfig.ts, automating this process with a prebuild script, and adding a CDN fallback for additional reliability.
