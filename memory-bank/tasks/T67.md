*Created: 2025-05-24*
*Last Updated: 2025-05-24*

## Task Information
**Title:** Tetrahedron Quantum State Construction
**Status:** ðŸ†• NEW - Ready to Start
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** 2025-05-24
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-24 23:50 IST
**Dependencies:** T66 (Multi-Spin Coupling - Phase 1 Complete)

## Description
Implement quantum state construction for tetrahedral spin network vertices using the multi-spin coupling foundation from T66. This involves assembling four triangular faces into a closed 3D tetrahedron with proper vertex constraints and edge-face coherence.

## Background
With T66 Phase 1 complete, multi-spin coupling now works for arbitrary numbers of spins, enabling construction of quantum states for complex 3D structures. The tetrahedron represents the fundamental 3D building block for spin networks and provides the foundation for 3D quantum geometry.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components:
1. **Vertex Constraint Enforcement**: Force J=0 total angular momentum at each vertex
2. **Edge-Face Coherence**: Ensure edges shared by faces have consistent spin values
3. **Tetrahedron Assembly**: Combine 4 triangular faces into closed 3D structure
4. **Topological Validation**: Verify proper tetrahedron topology and constraints

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Vertex Constraints
- Implement J=0 constraint enforcement for 4-valent vertices
- Create vertex state validation functions
- Test with known tetrahedron configurations

### Phase 2: Edge-Face Coherence  
- Design edge labeling system for shared edges
- Implement edge consistency checking
- Create face-to-face matching algorithms

### Phase 3: Tetrahedron Assembly
- Combine individual faces into complete tetrahedron
- Apply global topological constraints
- Integration with existing spin network infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Can construct valid tetrahedron quantum states with J=0 vertices
- [ ] All edges maintain consistency between adjacent faces
- [ ] Integration with existing IntertwinerData interface
- [ ] Validation of tetrahedron topology and quantum constraints

## Files to Create
- `packages/quantum/src/geometry/tetrahedron.ts` - Core tetrahedron construction
- `packages/quantum/src/geometry/vertexConstraints.ts` - Vertex constraint enforcement
- `packages/quantum/__tests__/geometry/tetrahedron.test.ts` - Tests

## Success Metrics
- Successfully construct quantum states for regular tetrahedron
- All vertex constraints properly enforced
- Edge coherence maintained across all faces
- Ready for integration with 3D spin network applications

## Notes
This task builds directly on T66's multi-spin coupling breakthrough. The mathematical foundation is now solid - the focus is on geometric assembly and constraint enforcement for 3D quantum structures.
