# T64a: Implement @spin-network/graph-core Package

**Description**: Create a robust and reusable graph data structure package as part of the Graph-Quantum Integration Restructuring. This package will provide abstract graph algorithms and operations that can be integrated with quantum-specific extensions.

**Status**: ðŸ”„ **Last**: 2025-05-15 12:30 IST

**Progress**:
1. Package Setup:
   - âœ… Created minimal graph-core package structure
   - âœ… Set up basic package.json with dependencies
   - âœ… Added placeholder type definitions
   - â¬œ Remaining core implementation pending evaluation results

2. Test Application Setup (graph-test-app):
   - âœ… Created initial package structure
   - âœ… Set up configuration files and dependencies
   - âœ… Created basic application structure using template-core
   - âœ… Set up routing and component templates
   - âœ… Implemented core UI structure:
     - âœ… Panel layout using ResizablePanelLayout
     - âœ… Workspace components (GraphManager, Controls)
     - âœ… Redux store integration
     - âœ… Panel size persistence (including bottom panel)
     - âœ… Basic UI with controls and visualization area
   - â¬œ Graph operation functionality not started
   - â¬œ Backend adapters not implemented
   - â¬œ Performance monitoring not implemented
   - â¬œ Library evaluation not started

**Priority**: HIGH

## Implementation Plan

### Revised Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Basic Visualization (Current Focus)
- âœ… Set up minimal graph-test-app
- âœ… Basic package structure
- ðŸ”„ Direct Graphology integration
- ðŸ”„ Basic Sigma.js visualization
- â¬œ Simple node/edge creation
- â¬œ Basic interaction controls

### Phase 1: Essential Features
- â¬œ Basic graph operations (add/remove nodes/edges)
- â¬œ Simple state management
- â¬œ Required UI controls
- â¬œ Testing of core functionality

### Phase 2: Pattern Identification
- â¬œ Document common usage patterns
- â¬œ Identify abstraction points
- â¬œ Test with real use cases
- â¬œ Validate assumptions

### Phase 3: Minimal Abstractions
- â¬œ Create necessary interfaces
- â¬œ Implement proven patterns
- â¬œ Keep abstractions simple
- â¬œ Maintain clear documentation

### Phase 4: Refinement
- â¬œ Optimize performance
- â¬œ Enhance user experience
- â¬œ Add advanced features as needed
- â¬œ Comprehensive testing

## Current Focus

The current implementation focus is on the graph-test-app, which will serve as our testing ground for different graph libraries. The app structure has been set up with:

1. **Core Layout**:
   - ResizablePanelLayout with persistent panel sizes
   - Left panel for controls
   - Main panel for graph visualization
   - Right panel for properties
   - Bottom panel for logging/debug info

2. **State Management**:
   - Redux store integration
   - Basic graph state slice
   - Action types defined

3. **UI Components**:
   - GraphManager for visualization
   - Control panel with backend selection
   - Zoom controls
   - Properties panel

Next steps:
1. Implement graph visualization with both libraries
2. Add basic graph operations
3. Create performance monitoring system
4. Compare and evaluate libraries

**Dependencies**: T64
**Notes**: 

Initial Implementation Review (2025-05-16):
We identified significant overengineering in our initial approach:

1. Premature Abstractions:
   - Created complex type hierarchy before understanding usage patterns
   - Built sophisticated state management before basic visualization
   - Designed comprehensive interface system without concrete use cases

2. Corrected Approach:
   - Start with direct Graphology and Sigma.js integration
   - Get basic visualization working first
   - Add features incrementally based on actual needs
   - Focus on simple, working implementation before abstraction

3. Key Lessons:
   - Follow YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle
   - Validate basic functionality before adding complexity
   - Let patterns emerge from actual usage
   - Keep implementation focused on current requirements
   - Test and verify each step before moving forward

4. Revised Implementation Strategy:
   a. Phase 1: Basic Visualization
      - Direct Graphology/Sigma.js integration
      - Simple node/edge creation
      - Basic interaction controls
   b. Phase 2: Core Features
      - Add essential graph operations
      - Implement basic state management
      - Add required UI controls
   c. Phase 3: Abstractions (only after patterns emerge)
      - Identify common patterns from working code
      - Create minimal necessary abstractions
      - Maintain simplicity and clarity
