- Store additional properties in flexible data structures for extensibility

### API Design
- Follow functional programming principles with immutable data structures
- Support method chaining for graph operations
- Provide both high-level and low-level access to graph structure
- Ensure consistent error handling and validation

### Algorithm Implementation

- Good serialization capabilities
- Active development and maintenance
- Clean and modern API

**Cytoscape.js**:
- Used in our current React app components for visualization
- Strong documentation and extensive features
- Recently added native TypeScript support (v3.31.0)
- Well-maintained with good community support
- Primarily designed for visualization but includes robust graph algorithms

**ngraph.graph**:
- Extremely performant for large graphs
- Simple, focused API
- Excellent memory efficiency
- Part of a larger ecosystem of graph-related tools
- Less active development than other options

**Graph Types Definitions**:
- **Mixed Graphs**: Graphs containing both directed and undirected edges simultaneously
- **Compound Graphs**: Hierarchical graphs where nodes can contain other nodes (parent-child relationships)

## Implementation Considerations

When choosing whether to build a custom implementation or leverage an existing library, consider:

1. **Integration Requirements**:
   - All libraries would require custom adapters for our quantum package
   - Math.js integration would need to be implemented for any choice

2. **Development Time vs. Control**:
   - Using Graphology would significantly reduce development time
   - Custom implementation provides maximum control over internals
   - A hybrid approach (wrapping Graphology) balances both concerns

3. **Current Usage**:
   - Cytoscape.js is already used in our React components, but primarily for visualization
   - Our SpinNetworkGraph class has existing custom logic that might need to be preserved

4. **Long-term Maintenance**:
   - Libraries reduce maintenance burden for core graph algorithms
   - Custom code increases maintenance needs but provides more flexibility

## Notes
This task implements the abstract graph component of the larger T64 Graph-Quantum Integration Restructuring project. The graph-core package provides the foundation for the new architectural approach by creating abstract graph structures that can later be extended with quantum-specific functionality in the spin-network package.

Rather than building everything from scratch, we should evaluate using Graphology or other existing graph libraries as the foundation. If we choose to use an existing library, we should focus on creating appropriate wrappers and extensions that integrate well with our quantum package.

Performance will be critical, especially for large graph operations that may be needed for complex quantum networks. We should benchmark different approaches before committing to a specific implementation strategy.

Our existing SpiNetworkGraph in lib/graph contains custom implementation that already integrates with math.js for matrix operations. If we choose to use a library, we need to ensure it can either replicate this functionality or provide additional benefits that justify the migration effort.
