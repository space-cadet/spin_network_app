# T64a: Implement @spin-network/graph-core Package

**Description**: Create a robust and reusable graph data structure package as part of the Graph-Quantum Integration Restructuring. This package will provide abstract graph algorithms and operations that can be integrated with quantum-specific extensions.

**Status**: ðŸ”„ **Last**: 2025-05-15 12:30 IST

**Progress**:
1. Package Setup:
   - âœ… Created minimal graph-core package structure
   - âœ… Set up basic package.json with dependencies
   - âœ… Added placeholder type definitions
   - â¬œ Remaining core implementation pending evaluation results

2. Test Application Setup (graph-test-app):
   - âœ… Created initial package structure
   - âœ… Set up configuration files and dependencies
   - âœ… Created basic application structure using template-core
   - âœ… Set up routing and component templates
   - âœ… Implemented core UI structure:
     - âœ… Panel layout using ResizablePanelLayout
     - âœ… Workspace components (GraphManager, Controls)
     - âœ… Redux store integration
     - âœ… Panel size persistence (including bottom panel)
     - âœ… Basic UI with controls and visualization area
   - â¬œ Graph operation functionality not started
   - â¬œ Backend adapters not implemented
   - â¬œ Performance monitoring not implemented
   - â¬œ Library evaluation not started

**Priority**: HIGH

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Evaluation & Prototyping
- âœ… Set up minimal graph-core package
- ðŸ”„ Test Application Setup
- â¬œ Library Evaluation

### Phase 1: Package Setup
- â¬œ Configure build system and dependencies

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- â¬œ Implement core interfaces and data structures

### Phase 3: Graph Algorithms
- â¬œ Implement core graph algorithms

### Phase 4: Integration Support
- â¬œ Create adapters and utilities

### Phase 5: Testing
- â¬œ Implement comprehensive testing

## Current Focus

The current implementation focus is on the graph-test-app, which will serve as our testing ground for different graph libraries. The app structure has been set up with:

1. **Core Layout**:
   - ResizablePanelLayout with persistent panel sizes
   - Left panel for controls
   - Main panel for graph visualization
   - Right panel for properties
   - Bottom panel for logging/debug info

2. **State Management**:
   - Redux store integration
   - Basic graph state slice
   - Action types defined

3. **UI Components**:
   - GraphManager for visualization
   - Control panel with backend selection
   - Zoom controls
   - Properties panel

Next steps:
1. Implement graph visualization with both libraries
2. Add basic graph operations
3. Create performance monitoring system
4. Compare and evaluate libraries
