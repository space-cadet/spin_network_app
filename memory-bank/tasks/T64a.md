   - 10 different graph types: empty, complete, path, random, randomSparse, lattice1D, lattice2D, lattice1DPeriodic, lattice2DPeriodic, triangularLattice
   - Dynamic parameter forms that adapt to selected graph type
   - Proper coordinate handling for lattice vs non-lattice graphs

2. **Complete UI Integration**:
   - Graph Builder Controls integrated into left sidebar
   - Scrollable sidebar for all controls
   - Professional parameter input forms with validation
   - Generate button triggers actual graph creation

3. **Visualization Pipeline**:
   - Redux store manages graph state with `setGraph` action
   - GraphManager uses Redux store to display generated graphs
   - Automatic layout positioning (lattice coordinates vs circular layout)
   - Proper styling with consistent node/edge appearance

4. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Full integration between graph-core builders and graph-test-app
   - GraphologyAdapter seamlessly connects to Sigma.js visualization
   - Error handling and console logging for debugging
   - Type-safe Redux integration with proper TypeScript types

**Next Focus**: Phase 2 will add manual graph editing capabilities, properties display, and algorithm visualization on top of the solid foundation established in Phase 1.

**Notes**: 

Initial Implementation Review (2025-05-16):
We identified significant overengineering in our initial approach:

1. Premature Abstractions:
   - Created complex type hierarchy before understanding usage patterns
   - Built sophisticated state management before basic visualization
   - Designed comprehensive interface system without concrete use cases

2. Corrected Approach:
   - Start with direct Graphology and Sigma.js integration
   - Get basic visualization working first
   - Add features incrementally based on actual needs
   - Focus on simple, working implementation before abstraction

3. Key Lessons:
   - Follow YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle
   - Validate basic functionality before adding complexity
   - Let patterns emerge from actual usage
   - Keep implementation focused on current requirements
   - Test and verify each step before moving forward

4. Revised Implementation Strategy:
   a. Phase 1: Basic Visualization
      - Direct Graphology/Sigma.js integration
      - Simple node/edge creation
      - Basic interaction controls
   b. Phase 2: Core Features
      - Add essential graph operations
      - Implement basic state management
      - Add required UI controls
   c. Phase 3: Abstractions (only after patterns emerge)
      - Identify common patterns from working code
      - Create minimal necessary abstractions
      - Maintain simplicity and clarity
