## Task Information
**Title:** Enhance Simulation Data Export and Visualization
**Description**: Improve the simulation data export functionality and visualization capabilities to make simulation results more accessible and useful for analysis.
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: April 17, 2025
**Last Active**: April 17, 2025 (16:45 IST)
**Dependencies**: -
**Completion Criteria**:
- âœ… Fix CSV export to include all geometric variables (totalVolume, totalArea, etc.)
- âœ… Fix simulation logs panel to display non-zero geometric values 
- â¬œ Restore session persistence functionality between page reloads
- â¬œ Implement proper data format for time-series data export
- â¬œ Add basic visualization capabilities for simulation results
- â¬œ Create interactive graphs for simulation data analysis
- â¬œ Add ability to compare results between different simulation runs
- â¬œ Support export of visualization as images
- â¬œ Create tabular data view for detailed inspection

**Notes**:
Part of this task has been completed by fixing the CSV export functionality to properly include geometric variables that were previously missing or showing as zero. The display of these variables in the simulation logs panel has also been fixed. However, there's still an issue with session persistence between page reloads that needs to be addressed, and the visualization capabilities still need to be developed.
