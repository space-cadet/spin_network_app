## Task Information
**Title:** Enhanced Simulation Test Pages
**Description**: Improve the test-simulation.html page by adding randomized network generation and create a detailed physics notebook page that explains the simulation's mathematical foundations and implementation details.
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Last Active**: April 14, 2025 (22:15 IST)
**Completion Criteria**:
- Add randomized network generation to test-simulation.html
- Create a new physics-notebook.html page with detailed explanations
- Include mathematical equations and their corresponding code implementations
- Break down all geometric properties calculations
- Explain diffusion models and their physics foundations
- Make sections collapsible for better usability
- Add table of contents for easy navigation
- Link the test and notebook pages together
- Create responsive design for all viewport sizes

**Related Files**:
- `/public/test-simulation.html`
- `/public/physics-notebook.html` (new file)
- `/src/test-simulation.js`

**Notes**:
The enhanced test pages will serve as educational resources to help users understand the physics and mathematics behind the simulation. The randomized network generation will allow users to see how different network topologies affect the simulation results. The physics notebook provides a comprehensive explanation of all equations and their code implementations.
