## Design Principles

1. **Leverage POC Success**: Extract `QuantumGraph` from working POC
2. **Graph-Core Integration**: All builders use `GraphologyAdapter` foundation
3. **Quantum Operations**: Focus on quantum-specific graph algorithms
4. **Domain Separation**: Separate builders for different quantum graph types
5. **Adapter Pattern**: Clean integration layer with graph-core

## Key Features

- **Vertices labeled with quantum states**: |0âŸ©, |1âŸ©, |+âŸ©, superposition states
- **Edges labeled with quantum operators**: Pauli matrices, gates, Hamiltonians
- **Graph traversal with quantum operations**: Apply operators during traversal
- **Type-safe quantum object handling**: Leverages T72's QuantumObject union
- **Domain-specific builders**: Spin networks, quantum circuits, tensor networks
- **Integration with graph-core**: Reuses existing graph infrastructure
