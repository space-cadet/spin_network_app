*Last Updated: 2025-05-30 19:20:00*

**Description**: Implement performance optimizations for quantum operator computations to reduce exponential scaling bottlenecks identified in scalability tests. Current operator operations take 3.2 seconds for 8 qubits, limiting practical usage to 6-7 qubits.

## Progress
1. â¬œ Analyze current bottlenecks in operator scaling test
2. â¬œ Implement SparseMatrix class with compressed storage
3. â¬œ Create IdentityOperator specialized class
4. â¬œ Add lazy matrix evaluation to MatrixOperator
5. â¬œ Implement in-place StateVector operations
6. â¬œ Update quantum gates to use specialized implementations
7. â¬œ Add streaming matrix-vector multiplication
8. â¬œ Create performance benchmarks and validation tests

## Context
Scalability analysis shows operator computations are the primary bottleneck:
- 6 qubits: 51ms (borderline acceptable)
- 7 qubits: 396ms (significant delay)
- 8 qubits: 3.2 seconds (impractical)

State vector operations scale much better (16 qubits in 75ms), indicating the issue is specifically with dense matrix operations in operator implementations. Tensor products remain efficient, suggesting optimization potential exists.

## Implementation Plan
**Phase 1: Infrastructure**
- Create sparse matrix utilities
- Add specialized operator base classes
- Implement lazy evaluation framework

**Phase 2: Core Optimizations**
- Replace identity operations with direct state returns
- Implement diagonal operator optimizations
- Add in-place state modifications

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- Streaming operations for large matrices
- Matrix-free operator implementations
- Decomposition-based operator strategies

Target: Extend practical limits to 10-12 qubits with current memory constraints.
