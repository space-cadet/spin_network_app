# T74: Optimize Quantum Operator Performance
*Last Updated: 2025-05-30 19:20:00*

**Description**: Implement performance optimizations for quantum operator computations to reduce exponential scaling bottlenecks identified in scalability tests. Current operator operations take 3.2 seconds for 8 qubits, limiting practical usage to 6-7 qubits.

## Completion Criteria
- Implement sparse matrix support for identity and diagonal operators
- Add lazy matrix evaluation to avoid unnecessary computations
- Create specialized operator classes for common gates
- Implement in-place state operations to reduce memory allocation
- Extend practical limits from 6-7 qubits to 10-12 qubits
- Maintain mathematical correctness and API compatibility

## Progress
1. âœ… Implementation plan created with KIRSS principles
2. âœ… **PHASE 1 COMPLETE**: Infrastructure implemented
   - âœ… Added sparse interfaces to core types (ISparseEntry, ISparseMatrix, ISparseOperator)
   - âœ… Created sparse matrix utilities (284 lines) with full operations suite
   - âœ… Added comprehensive test suite (17 tests, all passing)
3. â¬œ **PHASE 2**: Core optimizations (specialized operators, MatrixOperator sparse support)
4. â¬œ **PHASE 3**: Exports and integration

## Context
Scalability analysis shows operator computations are the primary bottleneck:
- 6 qubits: 51ms (borderline acceptable)
- 7 qubits: 396ms (significant delay)
- 8 qubits: 3.2 seconds (impractical)

State vector operations scale much better (16 qubits in 75ms), indicating the issue is specifically with dense matrix operations in operator implementations. Tensor products remain efficient, suggesting optimization potential exists.

## Implementation Plan
**Phase 1: Infrastructure**
- Create sparse matrix utilities
- Add specialized operator base classes
- Implement lazy evaluation framework

**Phase 2: Core Optimizations**
- Replace identity operations with direct state returns
- Implement diagonal operator optimizations
- Add in-place state modifications

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- Streaming operations for large matrices
- Matrix-free operator implementations
- Decomposition-based operator strategies

Target: Extend practical limits to 10-12 qubits with current memory constraints.
