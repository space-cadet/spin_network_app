# T65: Release @spin-network/quantum as Standalone NPM Package

**Description**: Prepare and publish the @spin-network/quantum package to npm as a standalone package for public use.

**Status**: ⬜ **Last**: 2025-05-12 23:00 IST

**Priority**: HIGH

## Objectives

1. Prepare the package.json and documentation for public release
2. Test the package in isolation before publication
3. Publish the package to npm under the @spin-network organization
4. Create proper release documentation

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Package Preparation
- ⬜ Verify and update package.json fields (version, description, keywords, etc.)
- ⬜ Add publishConfig with public access setting
- ⬜ Create .npmignore file to exclude development files
- ⬜ Update README.md with comprehensive documentation
- ⬜ Ensure all exports are properly defined in index.ts

### Phase 2: Pre-Release Testing
- ⬜ Create a tarball using npm pack
- ⬜ Test installation in a separate project
- ⬜ Verify all functionality works correctly
- ⬜ Fix any issues found during testing

### Phase 3: Publication
- ⬜ Create or verify @spin-network organization on npm
- ⬜ Login to npm with appropriate credentials
- ⬜ Publish the package to npm
- ⬜ Verify the package is accessible and installable

### Phase 4: Post-Release
- ⬜ Tag the release in git
- ⬜ Create release documentation
- ⬜ Update project documentation to reference the published package

## Files

### Package Files
- `packages/quantum/package.json` - Package configuration
- `packages/quantum/README.md` - Package documentation
- `packages/quantum/.npmignore` - Files to exclude from publication

### Documentation Files
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/quantum-package-release.md` - Release documentation

## Dependencies
- T64 (Graph-Quantum Integration Restructuring)
- T63 (Enhance Quantum Library Documentation)

## Notes
Publishing @spin-network/quantum as a standalone npm package will make the quantum mechanics library available for broader usage outside the spin network application. This supports the project's goal of providing modular, reusable quantum computing tools.

The package already builds successfully, which indicates it's technically ready for release. This task focuses on the publication process and ensuring the package is properly documented and configured for public consumption.

Key considerations:
1. Version numbering - Starting with 0.1.0 to indicate early development status
2. Public access - Ensuring the scoped package is publicly accessible
3. Documentation - Providing clear usage examples and API documentation
4. Testing - Verifying the package works correctly when installed in other projects
