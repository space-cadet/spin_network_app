## Task Information
**Title:** Fix Library Build Errors
**Description**: Fix the build errors in the standalone library by implementing missing analysis modules (conservation.ts, geometricProps.ts, statistics.ts) in the lib directory. Currently, the library cannot be built as shown by the error "Could not resolve './conservation' from 'lib/analysis/index.ts'".
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Last Active**: April 16, 2025 (07:45 IST)
**Completed**: April 16, 2025 (07:45 IST)
**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ Create directory structure for analysis modules
- ✅ Implement conservation.ts based on the src/simulation/analysis/conservation.ts file
- ✅ Implement geometricProps.ts based on the src/simulation/analysis/geometricProps.ts file
- ✅ Implement statistics.ts based on the src/simulation/analysis/statistics.ts file
- ✅ Simplify adapters/index.ts to avoid additional missing modules
- ✅ Fix utilities module with minimal implementation to avoid missing files
- ✅ Fix ConservationLawChecker interface export issue
- ✅ Test library build process (pnpm run build:lib)
- ✅ Ensure standalone test page works with built library
- ✅ Address simulation execution and UI update issues

**Related Files**:
- `/lib/analysis/index.ts`
- `/lib/analysis/conservation.ts` (to be created)
- `/lib/analysis/geometricProps.ts` (to be created)
- `/lib/analysis/statistics.ts` (to be created)
- `/src/simulation/analysis/conservation.ts` (reference)
- `/src/simulation/analysis/geometricProps.ts` (reference)
- `/src/simulation/analysis/statistics.ts` (reference)
- `/lib-bundle.config.js`
- `/package.json`

**Notes**:
This task is critical for enabling the standalone library functionality that is required by the Standalone Test Page (T10). The build error is due to missing analysis modules that are referenced in the analysis/index.ts file but don't exist in the lib directory.
