## Task Information
**Title:** Enhance Node and Edge Data Structures for Intertwiners
**Description**: Enhance the data structures for nodes and edges in the spin network to better represent the physics concepts, particularly improving the intertwiner representation to support intertwiner spaces with multiple dimensions and basis states.
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Started**: April 21, 2025
**Last Active**: April 21, 2025 23:45 IST
**Dependencies**: T20
**Completion Criteria**:
- âœ… Define enhanced `IntertwinerData` interface to replace the simple numerical representation
- âœ… Update `NetworkNode` interface to use the new `IntertwinerData` interface
- âœ… Implement validation function to ensure intertwiner values are consistent with adjacent edge spins
- âœ… Update `networkToCytoscape` function to handle the new intertwiner representation
- âœ… Update any functions that create or modify nodes to support the new interface
- âœ… Maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- âœ… Add utility functions to calculate intertwiner dimension based on adjacent edge spins
- â¬œ Add documentation about the new data structure

**Notes**:
The current implementation represents intertwiners as simple numerical values, which doesn't capture the full complexity of the physics model. This enhancement will modify the data structure to better represent intertwiner spaces with their dimensions and basis states, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code. The changes will lay the groundwork for more accurate physical simulations and visualizations of spin networks.

A comprehensive migration plan has been created in `standalone-migration-plan.md` that outlines a systematic approach with seven phases:
1. Identify all dependencies between React components and the simulation code
2. Complete missing features in the standalone library
3. Create a React adapter layer for integration
4. Update React components to use the adapters
5. Comprehensive testing of the integration
6. Remove duplicate implementation
7. Update documentation

The key technical challenge is implementing the proper adapter layer that translates between the event-based architecture of the standalone library and the Redux-based state management in the React app. The work in T14 (State Management Architecture) provides a foundation for this with the EventEmitter pattern and adapter interfaces.
