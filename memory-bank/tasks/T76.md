## Task Information
**Title:** Quantum Random Walk Implementation
**Status:** âœ… (Complete)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** 2025-06-03
**Started:** 2025-06-03
**Completed:** 2025-06-03

## Description
Implement a 2D quantum random walk model using existing infrastructure in packages/quantum and packages/graph-core. The implementation will leverage existing lattice builders from graph-core and quantum state management from the quantum package to create a complete quantum walk simulation framework.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement quantum walk framework with coin operators
- [x] Create shift operators for 2D movement based on coin states
- [x] Implement position-coin composite state management
- [x] Add analysis tools for probability distributions and spreading metrics
- [x] Create comprehensive examples demonstrating different quantum walk behaviors
- [x] Add test coverage for all quantum walk components
- [x] Integration with existing lattice builders from graph-core
- [x] Documentation of mathematical foundations and usage

## Implementation Details
The implementation will build on existing packages infrastructure:
- Use `lattice2D()` and `lattice2DPeriodic()` from graph-core for graph structures
- Leverage `StateVector`, `IOperator` interfaces from quantum package
- Implement coin operators (Hadamard, Grover, rotation-based)
- Create shift operators that move walker based on coin state
- Support both finite and periodic boundary conditions
- Provide analysis tools for quantum walk properties

Total estimated implementation: ~450 lines of code across quantum walk framework, coin operators, and analysis tools.
