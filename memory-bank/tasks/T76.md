## Task Information
**Title:** Quantum Random Walk Implementation
**Status:** ✅ (Complete)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** 2025-06-03
**Started:** 2025-06-03
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-12 19:23 IST

## Description
Implement a 2D quantum random walk model using existing infrastructure in packages/quantum and packages/graph-core. The implementation will leverage existing lattice builders from graph-core and quantum state management from the quantum package to create a complete quantum walk simulation framework.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement quantum walk framework with coin operators
- [x] Create shift operators for 2D movement based on coin states
- [x] Implement position-coin composite state management
- [x] Add analysis tools for probability distributions and spreading metrics
- [x] Create comprehensive examples demonstrating different quantum walk behaviors
- [x] Add test coverage for all quantum walk components
- [x] Integration with existing lattice builders from graph-core
- [x] Documentation of mathematical foundations and usage
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX**: Resolve probability conservation violations through proper boundary reflection
- [x] **UNITARITY**: Ensure unitary evolution with 100% probability conservation

## Implementation Details
The implementation will build on existing packages infrastructure:
- Use `lattice2D()` and `lattice2DPeriodic()` from graph-core for graph structures
- Leverage `StateVector`, `IOperator` interfaces from quantum package
- Implement coin operators (Hadamard, Grover, rotation-based)
- Create shift operators that move walker based on coin state
- Support both finite and periodic boundary conditions
- Provide analysis tools for quantum walk properties

Total estimated implementation: ~450 lines of code across quantum walk framework, coin operators, and analysis tools.

- 2025-06-12: **LITERATURE COMPARISON**: Compared implementation against established quantum walk algorithms
- 2025-06-12: **BUG DIAGNOSIS**: Identified amplitude accumulation at boundaries as root cause
- 2025-06-12: **CRITICAL FIX APPLIED**: Implemented coin state reflection instead of amplitude accumulation
- 2025-06-12: **VALIDATION**: All tests passing with perfect 100% probability conservation
- 2025-06-12: **DOCUMENTATION**: Updated random-walk-plan.md with fix details and completion status

## Resolution Summary
**Problem**: Amplitude accumulation at boundary positions violated unitarity principle
- Multiple coin states hitting boundaries caused probability duplication
- Total probability grew from 100% → 137.5% → 764.76% over evolution steps

**Solution**: Coin state reflection preserves unitary evolution
- UP coin hitting top boundary → becomes DOWN coin at same position
- DOWN coin hitting bottom boundary → becomes UP coin at same position
- LEFT coin hitting left boundary → becomes RIGHT coin at same position  
- RIGHT coin hitting right boundary → becomes LEFT coin at same position

**Results**: Perfect probability conservation achieved
- All 6 test cases now passing
- 100.00% total probability maintained throughout evolution
- Boundary reflections working correctly without violating quantum mechanics

## Notes
- Leverages existing lattice infrastructure, significantly reducing implementation scope
- Builds on proven quantum mechanics library foundation
- Designed for educational and research applications
- Can be extended to other lattice types (triangular, hexagonal) using existing builders
