- `/dist/lib/spin-network.umd.js` (generated)
- `/lib/core/types.ts`
- `/lib/io/serialization.ts`

**Notes**:
Successfully restructured the documentation file organization and fixed the basic path resolution issues for documentation pages. Created a standardized documentation structure in the public/docs folder with proper categorization and consistent file locations. The main documentation pages now load correctly in both local development and Vercel deployment.

Key improvements:
1. Reorganized all documentation into a standardized structure
2. Fixed DocsViewer component to properly handle file paths across environments
3. Added fallback paths to load files from different locations
4. Created dist/lib directory for UMD library
5. Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
6. Added placeholder MD files for HTML pages for consistency
7. Added error handling for script loading issues
8. Moved duplicate files to a deprecated folder for clean organization

While the basic documentation structure and navigation now work, there are still rendering and interaction issues that will be addressed in task T33.
