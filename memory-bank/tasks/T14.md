## Task Information
**Title:** State Management Architecture for Standalone Library
**Description**: Design a framework-agnostic event system for the standalone library that allows communication without UI framework dependencies. This task focuses on the design and implementation of the event system within the library itself, not the integration with React (which is covered by T34).
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: April 17, 2025
**Last Active**: April 17, 2025 (14:30 IST)
**Dependencies**: T13, T1
**Completion Criteria**:
- âœ… Analyze existing state management dependencies
- âœ… Design framework-agnostic event communication system
- âœ… Update architecture diagram with adapter layers for state management
- âœ… Update enhancement plan to include state management approach
- âœ… Create reference implementation for event system and adapters
- âœ… Ensure no direct Redux dependencies in the library
- âœ… Design persistence mechanism for saving/loading simulation state
- â¬œ Apply design to existing implementation of the engine
- â¬œ Implement event emitter in the core module
- â¬œ Test event system in standalone environments

**Notes**:
This task is crucial for achieving the goal of separating UI logic from simulation logic. By implementing a proper event-based communication system and adapter pattern, the standalone library can be used with any frontend framework while maintaining rich functionality. The reference implementation provides patterns for actual implementation in the library code.
