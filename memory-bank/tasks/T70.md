# T70: Fix Sigma.js v3 Integration Issues
*Last Updated: 2025-05-29*

**Description**: Fix Sigma.js v3 integration issues in the graph visualization system, including missing node/edge renderers and Redux serialization warnings that prevented proper graph rendering.

**Status**: ✅ **Priority**: HIGH  
**Started**: 2025-05-29 **Last**: 2025-05-29  
**Dependencies**: T64a (Graph core package), T64b (Graph UI package)

## Original Issues

### Issue 1: Missing Node Renderers
```
Uncaught Error: Sigma: could not find a suitable program for node type "default"!
    addNodeToProgram sigma.esm.js:2717
    GraphManager index.tsx:28
```
**Cause**: Sigma.js v3 requires explicit node program registration, but no renderers were registered for node types created by graph builders.

### Issue 2: Missing Edge Renderers  
```
Uncaught Error: Sigma: could not find a suitable program for edge type "default"!
    addEdgeToProgram sigma.esm.js:2735
    GraphManager index.tsx:29
```
**Cause**: Similar to nodes, edge types also required explicit renderer registration.

### Issue 3: Redux Serialization Warning
```
A non-serializable value was detected in the state, in the path: `graph.currentGraph`. Value: 
Object { graph: {…} }
Take a look at the reducer(s) handling this action type: graph/setGraph
```
**Cause**: Redux state contained non-serializable `GraphologyAdapter` instances.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Node Renderer Registration
**Files**: 
- `packages/graph-test-app/src/components/graph/GraphManager/index.tsx`
- `packages/graph-ui/src/components/canvas/GraphCanvas.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `NodeCircleProgram` import from `sigma/rendering`  
- Registered node programs for all types used by graph builders:
  - `default`: Most common node type
  - `circle`: Alternative node type
  - `lattice`: Used by lattice graph builders
  - `triangular_lattice`: Used by triangular lattice builder

```typescript
import { NodeCircleProgram } from 'sigma/rendering';

// In Sigma configuration:
nodeProgramClasses: {
  default: NodeCircleProgram,
  circle: NodeCircleProgram,
  lattice: NodeCircleProgram,
  triangular_lattice: NodeCircleProgram
}
```

### 2. Edge Renderer Registration
**Files**: Same as above

**Changes**:
- Added `EdgeLineProgram` import from `sigma/rendering`
- Registered edge programs for all edge types:
  - `default`: Most common edge type
  - `line`: Alternative edge type  
  - `lattice_edge`: Used by lattice builders
  - `triangular_edge`: Used by triangular lattice builder

```typescript
import { EdgeLineProgram } from 'sigma/rendering';

// In Sigma configuration:
edgeProgramClasses: {
  default: EdgeLineProgram,
  line: EdgeLineProgram,
  lattice_edge: EdgeLineProgram,
  triangular_edge: EdgeLineProgram
}
```

### 3. Redux Serialization Fix
**Files**:
- `packages/graph-test-app/src/store/graphSlice.ts`
- `packages/graph-test-app/src/components/panels/GraphBuilderControls.tsx`
- `packages/graph-test-app/src/components/graph/GraphManager/index.tsx`

**Changes**:

#### Redux State Structure
- Removed non-serializable `currentGraph: GraphologyAdapter` from state
- Added serializable `graphId: string` as a change trigger
- Created `SerializableGraphData` interface for action payloads

```typescript
interface SerializableGraphData {
  nodes: IGraphNode[];
  edges: IGraphEdge[];
  graphId: string;
}
```

#### Action Payload Extraction
- Extract serializable data before dispatching Redux actions
- Store GraphologyAdapter instance separately for rendering
- Only pass plain JavaScript objects to Redux

```typescript
// Extract serializable data from GraphologyAdapter
const nodes: IGraphNode[] = [];
const edges: IGraphEdge[] = [];

graphInstance.forEachNode((nodeId, attributes) => {
  nodes.push({
    id: nodeId,
    type: attributes?.type || 'default',
    properties: attributes || {}
  });
});

// Store for rendering, dispatch serializable data
setCurrentGraphInstance(generatedGraph);
dispatch(setGraph({ nodes, edges, graphId: uniqueId }));
```

#### Separated Concerns
- **Redux**: Manages serializable graph state (nodes, edges, metadata)
- **Module-level**: Manages non-serializable GraphologyAdapter for rendering
- **Components**: Use both data sources appropriately

## Completion Criteria
- [x] Node renderers registered for all graph builder types
- [x] Edge renderers registered for all graph builder types  
- [x] Redux serialization warnings eliminated
- [x] Graph visualization works for all 10 graph types
- [x] State management maintains functionality
- [x] No console errors during graph generation

## Testing Results
✅ **All graph types render successfully**:
- Empty, Complete, Path graphs
- Random and Random Sparse graphs  
- 1D and 2D lattices (regular and periodic)
- Triangular lattice graphs

✅ **No console errors**:
- Sigma.js renderer errors resolved
- Redux serialization warnings eliminated
- Graph generation and visualization working smoothly

## Files Modified
- `packages/graph-test-app/src/components/graph/GraphManager/index.tsx` - Added node/edge renderers
- `packages/graph-ui/src/components/canvas/GraphCanvas.tsx` - Added node/edge renderers  
- `packages/graph-test-app/src/store/graphSlice.ts` - Fixed Redux serialization
- `packages/graph-test-app/src/components/panels/GraphBuilderControls.tsx` - Extract serializable data

## Related Tasks
- **T64a**: Graph core package implementation (provided graph builders)
- **T64b**: Graph UI package (shared components affected)
- **T64**: Overall graph-quantum integration project

## Notes
This task successfully resolved all Sigma.js v3 compatibility issues that were preventing the graph-test-app from functioning. The solution maintains clean separation between serializable Redux state and non-serializable rendering objects, following Redux best practices while enabling proper graph visualization.

The fixes ensure the graph visualization system is robust and ready for further development in the graph-quantum integration project.
