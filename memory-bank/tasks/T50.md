## Task Information
**Title:** Fix StateVector TypeScript Implementation
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** 2025-05-03
**Started:** 2025-05-03
**Completed:** N/A

## Description
Fix TypeScript implementation issues in the SimulationStateVector class, focusing on proper interface implementation and math.js type compatibility. Address issues with missing toArray() method and math.js array handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement missing toArray() method in SimulationStateVector
- [x] Fix math.js array handling in fromMathArray
- [ ] Address remaining file system TypeScript errors
- [ ] Verify all type errors are resolved
- [ ] Documentation builds successfully

## Implementation Details
Implementation focused on two main areas:
1. Added toArray() method to properly implement StateVector interface
2. Fixed math.js array handling by:
   - Using valueOf() to convert Matrix to array
   - Proper type assertions for math.js arrays
   - Improved error handling for array conversions

## Progress Tracking
- 2025-05-03 16:30 IST: Added missing toArray() method
- 2025-05-03 16:30 IST: Fixed math.js array handling in fromMathArray

## Issues and Blockers
- Remaining TypeScript errors in file system operations need to be addressed
- Documentation build still showing broken links

## Notes
- SimulationStateVector implementation now properly handles math.js Matrix objects
- Added proper type assertions for math.js arrays
- Added error handling for array conversions
