*Last Updated: 2025-04-22 00:23:52*

## Task Information
**Title:** Advanced Simulation Analysis
**Description**: Add more in-depth analysis and visualization of simulation results. Implement additional tools for analyzing simulation data and provide more comprehensive insights into the behavior of spin networks.
**Status**: ⏸️ PAUSED
**Last Active**: April 14, 2025 (17:00 IST)
**Paused On**: April 14, 2025 (17:15 IST)
**Reason**: Dependent on completion of Simulation Library Abstraction (T1)
**Completion Criteria**:
- Add Fourier analysis of simulation results
- Implement spectral decomposition of operators
- Create correlation function calculator
- Add multi-scale analysis tools
- Implement export functionality for analysis results
- Create enhanced visualization components for analysis results

**Related Files**:
- `/src/simulation/analysis/conservation.ts`
- `/src/simulation/analysis/geometricProps.ts`
- `/src/simulation/analysis/statistics.ts`
- `/src/components/simulation/SimulationResultsPanel.tsx`

**Notes**:
This task will be resumed after the simulation library abstraction is complete, as the new library structure will make it easier to implement and integrate advanced analysis features.
