# T48: Test Files Reorganization
*Created: 2025-05-01*
*Last Updated: 2025-05-02 15:45 IST*

## Task Details
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: HIGH
**Created**: 2025-05-01
**Dependencies**: None

## Description
Reorganize test files into a new structured hierarchy separating React app tests from standalone library tests, while preserving existing functionality. Implement this using a phased approach to ensure no disruption to current testing capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- âœ… Create new test directory structure
- âœ… Implement shared test infrastructure (Phase 1):
  - âœ… Create testRunner.js with core testing framework
  - âœ… Create uiElements.js for shared DOM manipulation
  - âœ… Create visualizer.js for network visualization
  - âœ… Create testLogger.js for unified logging
- ðŸ”„ Implement Visualization Features (Phase 2):
  - âœ… Basic network visualization with canvas
  - âœ… Multiple layout types (grid, ring, line, random)
  - âœ… Node size and edge width controls
  - âœ… Node label toggle functionality
  - â¬œ State value visualization with color coding
  - â¬œ Advanced visualization features
- â¬œ Tensor Operations Panel (Phase 3):
  - â¬œ 2-Valent Node Tests
  - â¬œ 3-Valent Node Tests
  - â¬œ 4-Valent Node Tests
- â¬œ Advanced Features (Phase 4):
  - â¬œ Advanced Simulation Controls:
    - â¬œ Diffusion model selection
    - â¬œ Numerical method selection
    - â¬œ Time step configuration
  - â¬œ State Vector Operations:
    - â¬œ Edge operations
    - â¬œ State vector manipulation
- â¬œ Final Integration:
  - â¬œ Validate all tests work in both contexts
  - â¬œ Update documentation
  - â¬œ Clean up old test files

## Implementation Structure
- Organize features as collapsible panels in HTML
- Each component has dedicated JavaScript module
- Maintain separation between operations
- Progressive feature addition
- Clean component isolation

## Progress
1. âœ… Created new test directory structure
2. âœ… Implemented core test infrastructure files
3. âœ… Created initial visualization panel with controls
4. âœ… Implemented network rendering with multiple layouts
5. âœ… Added node/edge visualization controls
6. ðŸ”„ Working on advanced visualization features
7. â¬œ Tensor operations implementation pending
8. â¬œ Advanced simulation controls pending

## Next Steps
1. Complete state value visualization with color coding
2. Begin tensor operations panel implementation
3. Implement advanced simulation controls
4. Add state vector operations

## Notes
- Currently focusing on visualization feature completion
- Need to maintain backward compatibility during implementation
- Consider performance optimization for large networks

7. â¬œ Validate and clean up

## Context
This reorganization follows the plan outlined in `/memory-bank/implementation-details/test-reorganization-plan.md` and implements a cleaner separation between React-specific tests and standalone library tests. The implementation uses a phased approach to ensure no disruption to existing test functionality.

## Session Notes
- Successfully implemented all shared test infrastructure modules
- Created and styled tensor-operations.html for React context
- Implemented test runner with proper error handling and logging
- Added visualization capabilities for tensors and network graphs
- Created consolidated spin-network-suite.html to replace multiple standalone test files
- Added state persistence to maintain user configurations across sessions
- Implemented configurable graph creation and comprehensive results display
