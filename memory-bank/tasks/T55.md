## Task Information
**Title:** Enhance Quantum Features of Standalone Library
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Dependencies:** T36, T53

## Description
Enhance the quantum features of the standalone library by implementing a comprehensive set of quantum operations, building upon the existing state vector and tensor implementations. This task implements the plan detailed in `memory-bank/implementation-details/standalone-lib-quantum-plan.md`.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Quantum Foundations

#### 1.1 Enhanced Complex Number Operations
- Add `subtractComplex()`, `conjugateComplex()`, `modulusComplex()`
- Implement `isZeroComplex(tolerance)` for proper zero checking

#### 1.2 Hilbert Space Composition Tools
- Create `HilbertSpace` class for managing quantum state spaces
  ```typescript
  export class HilbertSpace {
    dimension: number;
    basis: string[];  // Optional basis labels
    
    static compose(space1: HilbertSpace, space2: HilbertSpace): HilbertSpace;
    static decompose(space: HilbertSpace, dims: number[]): HilbertSpace[];
    tensorProduct(other: HilbertSpace): HilbertSpace;
    partialTrace(subsystemDims: number[]): HilbertSpace;
  }
  ```
- Implement tensor product of spaces

- Support basis labeling and tracking
- Add tools for handling composite systems

#### 1.3 Unified Operator Framework
- Implement abstract `Operator` interface
- Add operator composition and adjoint operations
- Create `MatrixOperator` implementation
- Add support for operations across composed spaces
```typescript
export interface Operator {
  dimension: number;
  hilbertSpace?: HilbertSpace;  // Optional space information
  apply(state: StateVector): StateVector;
  compose(other: Operator): Operator;
  adjoint(): Operator;
  toMatrix(): Complex[][];
  // New methods for composed spaces
  extendToSpace(fullSpace: HilbertSpace, position: number): Operator;

}
```
