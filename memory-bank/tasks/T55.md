## Implementation Notes

### Code Reorganization Required
**Priority: HIGH**
Discovered substantial code duplication and organizational issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Duplicate Functionality**:
- State vector operations duplicated across hilbertSpace.ts and stateVector.ts
- Tensor product operations scattered across multiple files
- State creation methods duplicated between HilbertSpace and states.ts

2. **Required Restructuring**:
- Rename hilbertSpace.ts to space.ts with pure space abstraction
- Create new operations/ directory for core quantum operations
- Create utils/ directory for shared utilities
- Consolidate tensor product operations
- Move state creation methods to appropriate modules

3. **New File Structure**:
```
lib/quantum/
â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts               // Core type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ complex.ts            // Complex number operations
â”œâ”€â”€ space.ts             // Pure Hilbert space abstraction
â”œâ”€â”€ stateVector.ts       // State vector operations
â”œâ”€â”€ states.ts            // Common quantum states
â”œâ”€â”€ operator.ts          // Operator implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ operations/          // Core quantum operations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tensorProduct.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ composition.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ measurement.ts
â””â”€â”€ utils/
    â”œâ”€â”€ validation.ts
    â””â”€â”€ math.ts
```

4. **Implementation Status**:
- Core complex operations complete
- Initial operator framework in place
- Basic quantum gates implemented
- Identified need for reorganization before proceeding

### Current Phase Status
Mixed States phase partially complete:
- Added density matrix interfaces and implementation
- Added quantum channel interface
- Working on Kraus operators and measures

Quantum Computation phase partially complete:
- Implemented core quantum gates (Pauli X/Y/Z, Hadamard, CNOT)
- Circuit framework pending

## Notes
- Code reorganization needed before continuing implementation
- Focus on clean separation of concerns
- Eliminate duplicate functionality
- Maintain backwards compatibility during restructuring
- Integration tests needed for reorganized components
