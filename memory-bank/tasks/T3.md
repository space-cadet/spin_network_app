# Task: T3
*Created: 2025-04-14*
*Last Updated: 2025-04-22 00:10:40*

## Task Information
**Title:** Component Refactoring
**Description**: Break down large components into smaller, more maintainable units. Improve organization and reduce complexity of UI components, particularly in the simulation-related panels.
**Status**: ⏸️ PAUSED
**Last Active**: April 14, 2025 (16:45 IST)
**Paused On**: April 14, 2025 (17:00 IST)
**Reason**: Dependent on completion of Simulation Library Abstraction (T1)
**Completion Criteria**:
- Break down SimulationResultsPanel.tsx into smaller components
- Refactor SimulationControlPanel.tsx into modular components
- Create reusable hooks for simulation data access
- Extract tab components into separate files
- Improve component organization and maintainability
- Implement better state management patterns
- Add comprehensive component documentation

**Related Files**:
- `/src/components/simulation/SimulationResultsPanel.tsx`
- `/src/components/panels/SimulationControlPanel.tsx`
- `/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts`
- `/src/hooks/useReduxSimulation.ts`

**Notes**:
This refactoring will be more efficient after the simulation library abstraction is complete, as the new architecture will clarify component boundaries and responsibilities.
