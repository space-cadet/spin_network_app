## Context

The project has evolved significantly with the recent focus on quantum library development (T55-T64). The memory bank files need to be updated to accurately reflect this shift in focus and ensure that all documentation is consistent with the current project state.

This is a meta task that sits outside the regular task numbering system, as it's a maintenance task that may need to be performed periodically to ensure that the memory bank remains accurate and useful.

## Target Files

- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Update to reflect quantum library focus
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Add quantum architecture patterns
- `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Update with quantum-specific technology details
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Update with latest task statuses
- `memory-bank/TODO.md` - Update with current priorities
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Ensure consistent with individual task files
- `README.md` - Update to reflect quantum library focus
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Add recent quantum library developments

## Implementation Plan

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Review all recent task files (T55-T64)
   - Identify key changes in project focus
   - Note inconsistencies in existing documentation

2. **Update Phase**
   - Update projectbrief.md with quantum focus
   - Update progress.md with latest task statuses
   - Update systemPatterns.md with quantum architecture
   - Update techContext.md with quantum technology details
   - Update TODO.md with current priorities

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Cross-check all updated files for consistency
   - Verify that all cross-references are accurate
   - Ensure terminology is consistent across all files

## Notes

This maintenance task is critical given the project's significant shift toward quantum library development with the latest tasks T55-T64. Regular updates to the memory bank ensure that documentation remains an accurate and helpful reference for all team members.

The memory bank should accurately reflect:
1. The quantum physics foundations of the project
2. The modular library architecture
3. The integration between graph theory and quantum mechanics
4. The current development priorities and achievements
