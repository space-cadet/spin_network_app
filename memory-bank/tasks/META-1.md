# META-1: Memory Bank Content Update

*Created: 2025-05-11 22:00 IST*
*Last Updated: 2025-05-11 22:00 IST*

## Task Details

**Description**: Update memory bank content to accurately reflect current project focus on quantum library development and integration.

**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

**Priority**: HIGH

**Started**: 2025-05-11

**Due**: 2025-05-15

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Update projectbrief.md to reflect quantum focus
- [ ] Update systemPatterns.md with quantum library architecture
- [ ] Update techContext.md with quantum-specific technology details
- [ ] Update progress.md with latest task statuses
- [ ] Update TODO.md with current priorities
- [ ] Ensure consistent terminology across all documents
- [ ] Validate all cross-references between memory bank files

## Context

The project has evolved significantly with the recent focus on quantum library development (T55-T64). The memory bank files need to be updated to accurately reflect this shift in focus and ensure that all documentation is consistent with the current project state.

This is a meta task that sits outside the regular task numbering system, as it's a maintenance task that may need to be performed periodically to ensure that the memory bank remains accurate and useful.

## Target Files

- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Update to reflect quantum library focus
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Add quantum architecture patterns
- `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Update with quantum-specific technology details
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Update with latest task statuses
- `memory-bank/TODO.md` - Update with current priorities
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Ensure consistent with individual task files

## Implementation Plan

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Review all recent task files (T55-T64)
   - Identify key changes in project focus
   - Note inconsistencies in existing documentation

2. **Update Phase**
   - Update projectbrief.md with quantum focus
   - Update progress.md with latest task statuses
   - Update systemPatterns.md with quantum architecture
   - Update techContext.md with quantum technology details
   - Update TODO.md with current priorities

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Cross-check all updated files for consistency
   - Verify that all cross-references are accurate
   - Ensure terminology is consistent across all files

## Progress

- âœ… Created META-1 task
- âœ… Updated progress.md with latest task statuses
- âœ… Updated projectbrief.md with quantum focus
- âœ… Updated systemPatterns.md with quantum architecture and design patterns
- â¬œ Update techContext.md with quantum technology details
- â¬œ Update TODO.md with current priorities

## Notes

This maintenance task is critical given the project's significant shift toward quantum library development with the latest tasks T55-T64. Regular updates to the memory bank ensure that documentation remains an accurate and helpful reference for all team members.

The memory bank should accurately reflect:
1. The quantum physics foundations of the project
2. The modular library architecture
3. The integration between graph theory and quantum mechanics
4. The current development priorities and achievements
