## Task Information
**Title:** Standalone Test Page for Simulation Library
**Description**: Create a standalone HTML test page for demonstrating and testing the simulation library without requiring the full application. Implement a simple interface for creating networks, running simulations, and visualizing results.
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Started**: April 15, 2025 (19:30 IST)
**Last Active**: April 16, 2025 (07:45 IST)
**Dependencies**: T1
**Completion Criteria**:
- âœ… Create HTML structure with controls and visualization areas
- âœ… Implement JavaScript for graph creation and simulation control
- âœ… Add basic visualization using Canvas
- âœ… Implement simulation metrics calculation and display
- âœ… Create bundling configuration for the standalone library
- âœ… Fix build errors in the library
- âœ… Implement fixes to actually execute simulation steps
- âœ… Fix numerical stability issues in simulation display
- âœ… Fix infinite logging issue after simulation completion
- â¬œ Add more interactive controls
- â¬œ Enhance visualization with more data views
- â¬œ Add parameter adjustment interface
- â¬œ Create comprehensive documentation

- `/lib-bundle.config.js` (new file)
- `/package.json` (updated with build:lib script)

**Notes**:
This standalone test page serves as both a demonstration of the library's capabilities and a testing tool for the library's functionality. It provides a simpler way to test the simulation engine without depending on the full React application. The page includes basic controls for creating a graph, running simulations, and visualizing the results. A mock implementation of the library was created for browser testing while the actual library bundling is being set up.
