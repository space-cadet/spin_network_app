## Task Information
**Title:** Fix Multiple Dist Folders Issue
**Description**: Fix the build process that's generating multiple unwanted dist folders, causing issues with Vercel deployment. The issue involves nested dist folders being created during the build process.
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: April 24, 2025
**Last Active**: April 24, 2025
**Dependencies**: -
**Completion Criteria**:
- â¬œ Fix lib bundle config to prevent nested dist folder creation
- â¬œ Update build scripts to maintain correct output structure
- â¬œ Ensure proper cleanup of temporary build artifacts
- â¬œ Verify successful Vercel deployment without dist folder issues
- â¬œ Document build process changes in build documentation

**Related Files**:
- `/vite.config.ts`
- `/lib-bundle.config.js`
- `/package.json`

**Notes**:
Current build process is generating multiple dist folders:
- ./dist (main build output)
- ./dist/dist (nested, potentially from lib bundle)
- ./public/dist (pre-existing)

Initial analysis shows this might be due to:
1. Main Vite build outputting to dist
2. Lib bundle config potentially creating an additional dist folder
3. Build script sequence potentially not handling paths correctly

## Implementation Details
Current build sequence:
1. rm -rf dist (in project root)
2. pnpm clean
3. pnpm install
4. pnpm prebuild
5. pnpm build
6. pnpm build:lib

Issues identified:
1. Nested dist/dist folder appearing after build
2. Multiple dist locations causing confusion
3. Path resolution in lib bundle config needs review

## Progress Tracking
- 2025-04-24: Task created and initial analysis completed

## Issues and Blockers
- Multiple dist folders affecting Vercel deployment
- Build script sequence potentially creating unnecessary folders

## Notes
- Need to ensure build modifications don't affect library bundle functionality
- Consider consolidating build outputs to a single dist directory
- Review Vercel deployment configuration for compatibility with build changes
