## Task Information
**Title:** Complete Simulation Engine Migration to Standalone Library
**Description**: Fully migrate all simulation engine dependencies from the React app to the standalone library, ensuring there's only one version of the simulation engine in the codebase. This task builds upon the work in T1 (Simulation Library Abstraction) and T14 (State Management Architecture) to complete the migration and eliminate duplicate implementations.
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority**: HIGH
**Started**: April 21, 2025
**Last Active**: April 21, 2025 (22:30 IST)
**Dependencies**: T1, T14
**Completion Criteria**:
- âœ… Create comprehensive migration plan (stored in `/memory-bank/implementation-details/standalone-lib/standalone-migration-plan.md`)
- â¬œ Identify all React components that directly depend on src/simulation
- â¬œ Complete any missing features in the standalone library from feature comparison
- â¬œ Implement event system and adapter layer for React integration
- â¬œ Refactor React components to use adapters instead of direct simulation imports
- â¬œ Update hooks (useSimulation, useReduxSimulation) to use the adapters
- â¬œ Ensure state synchronization between Redux and simulation engine
- â¬œ Verify visualization components work correctly with the library
- â¬œ Add comprehensive tests for the integration
- â¬œ Remove src/simulation directory after successful migration
- â¬œ Update documentation to reflect the new architecture

**Notes**:
This task represents the final step in the Simulation Library Abstraction project, focusing on fully migrating all simulation logic from the React app to the standalone library. The goal is to ensure there's only one version of the simulation engine - the standalone library version - while the React app only contains the UI-specific code with adapters that connect to the library.
