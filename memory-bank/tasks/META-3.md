## Task Details

**Description**: Create and maintain component index files for @spin-network/graph-core and @spin-network/graph-ui packages, following the structure established by the quantum package component index.

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

**Priority**: HIGH

**Started**: 2025-05-29

**Completed**: 2025-05-29 02:43 IST

**Due**: 2025-06-02

**Last Updated**: 2025-05-29 02:43 IST

## Acceptance Criteria

### @spin-network/graph-core
- [x] Create `packages/graph-core/component-index.md`
- [x] Document core types and interfaces
- [x] Document graph builders
- [x] Document adapters (GraphologyAdapter)
- [x] Document utility functions
- [x] Create dependency graph
- [x] Document API status and stability
- [x] Add performance considerations

### @spin-network/graph-ui
- [x] Create `packages/graph-ui/component-index.md`
- [x] Document core components (GraphCanvas)
- [x] Document hooks (useGraphInstance)
- [x] Document controls components
- [x] Document utility functions
- [x] Create dependency graph
- [x] Document API status and stability
- [x] Add performance considerations

## Implementation Notes
- Created comprehensive documentation for graph-core package including all 10 graph builders
- Documented GraphologyAdapter with type safety improvements
- Created detailed documentation for graph-ui components and hooks
- Added dependency graphs showing relationships between components
- Documented API stability status for both packages
- Followed consistent format with quantum package index

### General Requirements
- [ ] Follow consistent format with quantum package index
- [ ] Include recent updates section
- [ ] Include clear TOC
- [ ] Document breaking changes
- [ ] Add usage examples
- [ ] Link to relevant tasks

## Context

The quantum package's component-index.md has proven valuable for maintaining clear documentation and tracking API stability. We should extend this practice to the new graph packages to ensure consistent documentation quality across the project.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Review quantum package index structure
   - Identify graph-core components and relationships
   - Identify graph-ui components and relationships

2. **Documentation Phase**
   - Create initial structure for both indices
   - Document existing components
   - Create dependency graphs
   - Add API status information

3. **Review Phase**
   - Cross-reference with existing documentation
   - Validate all component links
   - Ensure consistent terminology
   - Update related task documentation

4. **Integration Phase**
   - Link indices from package READMEs
   - Update development guidelines
   - Add to documentation build process
