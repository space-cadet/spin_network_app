**Notes**:
This task focuses on developing a test sandbox for implementing and validating tensor and state vector operations before integrating these features into the main application. By creating a dedicated testing environment, we can explore the mathematical representations and operations independently of the application's UI components.

The sandbox allows us to:
1. Test sparse tensor representation for efficient storage of intertwiner tensors
2. Explore quantum state vector operations for representing edge spins
3. Verify that tensor operations like contraction work correctly
4. Test the integration with the existing intertwinerSpace.ts functionality
5. Visualize tensors and state vectors for better understanding

Recent enhancements to the test output provide better validation of tensor properties and physical constraints, including:
- Element-by-element verification of tensor values
- Validation of triangle inequalities for 3-valent nodes
- Verification of tensor normalization
- Display of intermediate coupling ranges for 4-valent nodes

The implementation plan in tensor-test.md outlines the full approach in detail, with specific data structures, core components, and implementation phases.
