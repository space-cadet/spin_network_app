**Notes**:
This task focuses on developing a test sandbox for implementing and validating tensor and state vector operations before integrating them into the main application. By creating a dedicated testing environment, we can explore the mathematical representations and operations independently of the application's UI components. This approach will help us verify that the quantum-mechanical properties of spin networks are correctly implemented before adding complexity with the full application architecture.

The sandbox will allow us to:
1. Test sparse tensor representation for efficient storage of intertwiner tensors
2. Explore quantum state vector operations for representing edge spins
3. Verify that tensor operations like contraction work correctly
4. Test the integration with the existing intertwinerSpace.ts functionality
5. Visualize tensors and state vectors for better understanding

The implementation plan in tensor-test.md outlines the approach in detail, with specific data structures, core components, and implementation phases.
