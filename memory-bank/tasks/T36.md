**Notes**:
Recent enhancements include a collapsible panel system for better space management and organization, comprehensive tensor operations testing capabilities, and advanced simulation controls. The implementation now supports detailed validation of tensor properties including normalization, triangle inequalities for 3-valent nodes, and recoupling consistency for 4-valent nodes.

The sandbox provides a dedicated testing environment for:
1. Testing sparse tensor representation for efficient storage of intertwiner tensors
2. Exploring quantum state vector operations for representing edge spins
3. Validating physical constraints and mathematical properties
4. Testing template-based graph creation with various network topologies
