**Notes**:
Successfully improved the UI by:
1. Fixing zoom controls visibility during scrolling by restructuring the container to have a dedicated scrollable area while keeping controls fixed
2. Completely redesigning the network creation interface to replace tabs with a unified, more intuitive approach
3. Adding a single network name field that applies to all network types
4. Creating a visual network type selector with icons and descriptions
