## Context

### Problem Discovery
During routine testing of the quantum module, discovered that the `nestedCommutator` function was producing incorrect results for the Jacobi identity test. The sum `[X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z, X]] + [Z, [X, Y]]` was not evaluating to zero as expected mathematically.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the implementation logic of `nestedCommutator`:
1. **Incorrect processing order**: The function was not properly handling the nested structure
2. **Operand ordering problem**: Results from inner calculations were being used incorrectly in outer calculations
3. **Index interpretation confusion**: The complex index notation made it difficult to verify correctness

### Solution Implementation
1. **Fixed core algorithm**: Rewrote the nested commutator processing to handle innermost-to-outermost evaluation correctly
2. **Added simplified interface**: Created `createNestedCommutator([X, Y, Z])` for intuitive usage instead of complex index arrays
3. **Enhanced documentation**: Added concrete examples and clearly explained limitations
4. **Validated correctness**: Confirmed Jacobi identity now correctly evaluates to zero

### Key Improvements
- **Mathematical correctness**: Nested commutators now follow proper algebraic rules
- **Usability**: Simplified interface eliminates error-prone index notation
- **Documentation**: Clear examples show both usage patterns and theoretical validation
- **Testing infrastructure**: Automated test runner helps identify issues across the entire test suite

### Technical Details
The original implementation had a logical error in how it processed the indices array. The corrected version:
1. Starts with the innermost commutator using both indices from the last pair
2. For subsequent levels, uses the first index to select an operator and the previous result as the second operand
3. Processes from innermost to outermost, building the nested structure correctly

This ensures that `nestedCommutator([X, Y, Z], [[0, 1], [1, 2]])` correctly computes `[X, [Y, Z]]` rather than an incorrect structure.
