## Task Information
**Title:** Implement Testing and Documentation Pages
**Description**: Create dedicated Testing and Documentation pages with a consistent sidebar-based interface for accessing and displaying various technical resources, guides, and test files within the application.
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE

**Dependencies**: -
**Completion Criteria**:
- âœ… Create TestingPage component with sidebar navigation and iframe content display
- âœ… Add links to three test resources: standalone guide, simulation test, and tensor sandbox
- âœ… Create DocsPage component with similar sidebar navigation and content display
- âœ… Implement proper Markdown rendering with math and code support
- âœ… Add routes for both pages in App.tsx
- âœ… Add navigation links in MainLayout header
- âœ… Remove outdated documentation components and routes
- âœ… Ensure consistent styling between both pages
- âœ… Fix all rendering issues in Markdown display
- âœ… Test all links and resource loading

**Related Files**:
- `/src/components/testing/TestingPage.tsx` - New component for test resources
- `/src/components/testing/index.ts` - Export for testing component
- `/src/components/documentation/DocsPage.tsx` - New documentation component
- `/src/components/documentation/index.ts` - Export for documentation component
- `/src/App.tsx` - Updated routes
- `/src/components/layouts/MainLayout.tsx` - Updated navigation

**Notes**:
Completely redesigned the documentation and testing pages with a consistent sidebar-based interface. Removed the previous documentation components (DocsLayout, DocsSidebar, DocsViewer, DocumentationHome) and replaced them with a simpler, more consistent approach that matches the testing page design. Both pages now feature a sidebar with resource navigation and a main content area that displays the selected resource.

The documentation page includes proper Markdown rendering with support for GitHub-flavored Markdown, mathematical equations via KaTeX, and code syntax highlighting. The testing page provides access to three key test resources: the standalone implementation guide, simulation test page, and tensor sandbox.

Also removed the "Simulation" entry from the main layout header to streamline navigation. This implementation provides a more intuitive and consistent user experience for accessing documentation and testing resources.
