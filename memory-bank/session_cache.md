**Status:** üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Started:** 2025-04-18
**Last Active:** 2025-04-18 16:45 IST
**Dependencies:** T1

#### Context
Implementation of functionality for calculating the dimension and basis states of intertwiner spaces for nodes in spin networks with arbitrary edge spin labels, with particular focus on addressing the order-dependence issue in intertwiner dimension calculations.

#### Critical Files
- `/memory-bank/implementation-details/intertwiner-spaces.md` - Documentation of intertwiner space theory and calculations
- `/python/intertwiner-spaces.py` - Python implementation with permutation-invariant functions
- `/lib/core/intertwinerSpace.ts` - TypeScript implementation of intertwiner calculations
- `/lib/core/index.ts` - Updated to export intertwiner space functionality
- `/public/physics-notebook.html` - Added intertwiner spaces section with detailed explanations

#### Implementation Progress
1. ‚úÖ Create comprehensive documentation of intertwiner space theory
2. ‚úÖ Add step-by-step tutorial for calculating basis states
3. ‚úÖ Implement triangle inequality checking
4. ‚úÖ Implement intermediate spin calculation
5. ‚úÖ Implement intertwiner space dimension calculation

13. ‚úÖ Add intertwiner spaces section to physics-notebook.html
14. ‚¨ú Create visualization component for intertwiner spaces
15. ‚¨ú Implement comprehensive testing
16. ‚¨ú Add CG coefficient lookup tables for performance

#### Working State
Enhanced intertwiner space implementation with significant improvements and made educational content more accessible:

1. **Order Dependence Documentation**:
   - Added comprehensive explanation of why different orderings of the same spins can yield different dimensions
   - Documented the mathematical theory behind recoupling schemes and their physical meaning
   - Provided detailed examples showing how different permutations affect the calculation
   - Created clear diagrams and equations to explain the phenomenon
   - Added recommendations for handling this issue in practical calculations

2. **Permutation-Invariant Functions**:
   - Added `permutation_invariant_intertwiner_dimension` function that sorts spins before calculation
   - Added `max_intertwiner_dimension` function that calculates the maximum dimension across all recoupling schemes
   - Added `all_recoupling_dimensions` function that returns dimensions for all possible pairings
   - Implemented testing code to compare results across different input orderings

3. **Documentation Reorganization**:
   - Created a comprehensive table of contents for easier navigation
   - Restructured content to flow logically from basic concepts to advanced implementation
   - Unified notation and terminology throughout the document
   - Added more explicit examples and mathematical formulations
   - Enhanced explanations of physical interpretations
   
4. **Python Implementation Testing and Bug Fixing**:
   - Added verification code to demonstrate the order dependence issue
   - Created example calculations to compare different approaches
   - Added detailed logging of intermediate values to aid in understanding
   - Fixed critical bug in `allowed_intermediate_spins()` function that was incorrectly calculating intermediate spins
   - Fixed intertwiner dimension calculation to properly enforce angular momentum selection rules

5. **Quantum Angular Momentum Rules**:
   - Corrected the implementation to enforce proper quantum mechanical selection rules:
     - When coupling two integer spins, intermediate spins must be integers
     - When coupling two half-integer spins, intermediate spins must be integers
     - When coupling an integer and half-integer spin, intermediate spins must be half-integers
   - This fixed the case of `intertwiner_dimension(1, 0.5, 0.5, 1)` which now correctly returns 2 instead of 3
   
6. **Physics Notebook Integration**:
   - Added a new section on intertwiner spaces to the physics-notebook.html file
   - Included proper mathematical notation using KaTeX
   - Structured the content into logical subsections (basic concepts, dimension calculation, etc.)
   - Added implementation notes including the bug fix information from the error log
   - Ensured proper integration with the notebook's TOC and navigation system
   - Updated all subsequent section numbers to maintain proper sequence

The enhanced implementation now properly addresses the subtle but important issue that different recoupling schemes can yield different intertwiner dimensions even for the same set of spins, and provides multiple approaches to handle this in calculations. The bug fix ensures that all dimension calculations follow proper angular momentum physics.

2. ‚úÖ Fix BrowserFS path issues (absolute to relative paths)
3. ‚úÖ Improve BrowserFS initialization and testing
4. ‚¨ú Evaluate and select appropriate library (react-browser-fs-tree vs browserfs-explorer)
5. ‚¨ú Implement file system navigation component
6. ‚¨ú Create file content viewer
7. ‚¨ú Add file operations (download, delete)
8. ‚¨ú Integrate with simulation logs panel

#### Working State
Created comprehensive documentation outlining the implementation options, requirements, and design considerations for a BrowserFS file viewer component. Fixed critical path issues in the simulationLogger.ts that were preventing BrowserFS from creating log files.

Key findings and decisions:
1. **Root Cause of File System Errors**: BrowserFS was failing because it was trying to use absolute paths like `/Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/logs` instead of relative paths like `/logs` that BrowserFS expects.
2. **Selected Implementation Approach**: Documented various implementation options and recommended using react-browser-fs-tree as the initial implementation due to its specific design for BrowserFS and good React integration.
3. **Implementation Plan**: Created a phased implementation plan starting with basic viewing functionality and progressing to more advanced features.
4. **Fixed Path Issues**: Updated simulationLogger.ts to use relative paths and improved directory creation logic to work with BrowserFS.

The next step is to select and implement the chosen file viewer component, starting with basic navigation and viewing capabilities.

The implementation provides a solid foundation for working with intertwiner spaces in spin networks, enabling exploration of quantum states at nodes which is crucial for more advanced calculations in loop quantum gravity simulations.

Next steps for the intertwiner space module:
1. Implement visualization component for intertwiner spaces
2. Create comprehensive testing suite for the calculations
3. Add performance optimizations with pre-computed Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
4. Extend to support higher-valent nodes (beyond 4-valent)
5. Integrate with the existing simulation functionality

Previous session's work on I/O and serialization components also made significant progress, implementing:
- Comprehensive serialization utilities for simulation state
- Multiple storage adapters for different environments
- Export/import functionality in various formats
- High-level simulation storage API

Together, these additions continue to enhance the standalone library's capabilities and mathematical foundation.
