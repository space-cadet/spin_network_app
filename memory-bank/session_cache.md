## Status
CONTINUING

## Current Task
UI integration of the simulation component - Bug fixes and refinements

## Current Step
Improved error handling in useSimulation and enhanced UI feedback when no network is available.

## Critical Files
- `/src/components/panels/SimulationControlPanel.tsx`
- `/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts`
- `/src/components/simulation/SimulationResultsPanel.tsx`
- `/src/App.tsx`
- `/src/components/simulation/index.ts`

## State Information
- Fixed TypeError in useSimulation.ts:28 "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'nodes')"
- Added null checks for network data in useSimulation hook
- Improved SimulationControlPanel to show all controls even when no network is available
- Added a warning banner in the simulation panel when no network is present
- Enhanced SimulationResultsPanel to handle undefined values
- Added defensive coding to prevent runtime errors when Redux state is not fully loaded
- Added optional chaining operators for safer access to potentially undefined properties

## Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Created directory structure for simulation component
2. âœ… Implemented core interfaces in types.ts
3. âœ… Created simulation-plan.md with revised approach leveraging existing libraries
4. âœ… Implemented math.js adapter for matrix operations
5. âœ… Built state vector implementation for simulation state
6. âœ… Implemented graph model for network representation
7. âœ… Created weight function factory for different edge weight calculations
8. âœ… Implemented diffusion models (ordinary and telegraph)
9. âœ… Created time evolution engine
10. âœ… Implemented numerical solvers (Euler, Midpoint, RK4, Adaptive RKF45)
11. âœ… Created visualization adapter for Cytoscape.js
12. âœ… Implemented analysis tools (geometric properties, conservation laws, statistics)
13. âœ… Fixed all TypeScript errors in simulation component
14. âœ… Created enhanced SimulationControlPanel UI
15. âœ… Created SimulationResultsPanel for results visualization
16. âœ… Enhanced useSimulation hook for better engine integration
17. âœ… Fixed runtime errors when network data is not available
18. âœ… Improved UI feedback for simulation controls when no network is available
19. ðŸ”„ Connect simulation state to Cytoscape visualization
20. â¬œ Implement analysis results visualization with real data
21. â¬œ Add parameter presets for common simulation scenarios
22. â¬œ Implement import/export of simulation configuration

## Bug Fixes
1. Fixed error in useSimulation hook when accessing network.nodes and network is undefined
   - Added optional chaining and null checks
   - Added fallback empty array when nodes array is undefined
2. Improved SimulationControlPanel user experience
   - Added warning banner when no network is available instead of hiding controls
   - Disabled execution buttons when no network is available
   - Kept all parameter controls visible and configurable
3. Enhanced SimulationResultsPanel to safely handle undefined values
   - Added default values for all parameters
   - Used optional chaining for accessing nested properties

## Design Decisions
- Kept all simulation controls visible even when no network is available
- Added warning banner instead of hiding functionality
- Added contextual disabling of buttons to indicate what requires a network
- Used defensive coding approach throughout the components
- Implemented non-intrusive feedback about requirements for simulation
- Made components resilient to undefined or null Redux state

## Next Steps
1. Implement visualization adapter to connect simulation state to Cytoscape
2. Create actual data visualization components for simulation results
3. Add analysis features to the results panel (conservation laws, geometric properties)
4. Add more error handling and validation for user inputs
5. Implement presets for common simulation scenarios
6. Add import/export functionality for simulation configuration
7. Create comprehensive tests for the simulation UI

## Notes
- The improved design allows users to configure simulation parameters even before having a network
- Warning banners provide clear feedback without hiding functionality
- Visual disabling of buttons provides intuitive indication of what requires a network
- Need to ensure all buttons properly indicate when they cannot be used
- Could add tooltips to disabled buttons to provide even clearer feedback
