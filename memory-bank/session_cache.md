## State Information
- ‚úÖ Created database configuration with Dexie.js
- ‚úÖ Implemented comprehensive database schema for logs, simulations, and graphs
- ‚úÖ Created service classes with full CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Implemented migration utilities for existing markdown logs
- ‚úÖ Added LogService with advanced querying and export functionality
- ‚úÖ Created Redux integration for logs with async thunks
- ‚úÖ Fixed LogViewerAdapter component with PrimeReact DataTable
- ‚úÖ Connected LogViewerAdapter to Redux
- ‚úÖ Updated store/index.ts to include logsSlice
- ‚úÖ Added scoped CSS for PrimeReact components
- ‚úÖ Created enhanced logs panel with simulation and application tabs
- ‚úÖ Implemented log rotation protocol
- ‚úÖ Created log archive structure
- ‚úÖ Fixed template literal syntax error in logMigrationUtil.ts
- üîÑ Updating Memory Bank documentation
- ‚òê Test log rotation functionality
- ‚òê Test enhanced logs panel in the application

## Next Steps
1. Complete and test log rotation functionality:
   - Test log rotation logic during app startup
   - Verify archive directory structure
   - Ensure smooth transition from one log file to another

2. Test enhanced logs panel in application:
   - Verify PrimeReact components use scoped styling
   - Test tab switching between simulation and application logs
   - Test log migration tool

3. Potential future improvements:
   - Add automated log rotation checks on startup
   - Create log statistics visualization
   - Implement full-text search across archived logs

## Implemented Features
- Database schema design with Dexie.js
- Log entry models with specialized types for errors and edits
- Advanced log querying with filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Migration utilities for existing markdown logs
- Export capabilities for logs (JSON and Markdown formats)
- Redux integration with async thunks
- PrimeReact DataTable integration with scoped CSS
- Log rotation protocol with directory structure
- Enhanced logs panel with simulation and application logs
- Scoped CSS for PrimeReact components

## Known Issues to Fix
1. Need to test log rotation with actual large log files
2. Need to test CSS scoping across different browsers
3. Need to verify performance with large datasets

## Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Database configuration and schema
- ‚úÖ Log service implementation
- ‚úÖ Redux slice for logs integration
- ‚úÖ LogViewerAdapter UI component
- ‚úÖ CSS isolation for PrimeReact components
- ‚úÖ Log rotation protocol and implementation
- ‚úÖ Application and simulation logs integration
- üîÑ Testing and documentation
