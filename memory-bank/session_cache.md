## Current Task
Fixing build errors and runtime simulation errors

## Current Step
Working on NetworkInteractionManager Cytoscape event binding issues

## Critical Files

- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/tsconfig.json

## State Information
- Addressed Cytoscape-related event handling issues in NetworkInteractionManager.tsx by:
  - Updating import to use `import * as cytoscape from 'cytoscape'`
  - Using named function expressions for event handlers
  - Using proper event registration patterns for Cytoscape
- Still encountering TypeScript errors with event binding in NetworkInteractionManager.tsx
- Error occurs at lines 167 and 212, related to event handler function types
- Changed `function onHandler()` declarations to `const onHandler = function() {}` syntax
- Need alternative approach to Cytoscape event binding that satisfies TypeScript

## Next Steps
- Continue fixing NetworkInteractionManager event binding issues
- Try different event binding approaches for Cytoscape
- Consider creating a local type definition or assertions for event handlers
- Test with different TypeScript configuration options if needed
- Run full build once issues are resolved
- Prepare comprehensive documentation for Cytoscape event binding pattern
