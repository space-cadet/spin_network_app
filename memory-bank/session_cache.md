## Status
[CONTINUING]

## Current Task
Improving the simulation visualization and results display

## Current Step
Fixed several components of the simulation visualization and results display system

## Critical Files
- `/src/components/simulation/SimulationResultsPanel.tsx` - Added auto-refresh and better display logic 
- `/src/simulation/visualization/cytoscapeAdapter.ts` - Enhanced visualization with better normalization
- `/src/components/panels/SimulationControlPanel.tsx` - Added better simulation parameters
- `/src/simulation/core/mathAdapter.ts` - Fixed matrix multiplication error

## State Information
We've made significant progress fixing the simulation visualization:

1. Fixed core matrix multiplication error that was preventing simulation from running properly
2. Enhanced the SimulationResultsPanel to properly display data and auto-refresh
3. Improved the CytoscapeAdapter to provide better visual feedback
4. Updated the SimulationControlPanel with more stable parameter defaults

The current issues we're still facing:
1. Need to fix the Workspace.tsx visualization update code (attempted but had runtime errors)
2. The SimulationLogsPanel needs refreshing, though this has been partially addressed
3. Some visual artifacts or lack of clear feedback in the node visualization

Next steps:
1. Continue work on improving the Workspace.tsx visualization effect
2. Add more visual feedback for simulation state to nodes
3. Enhance the refresh mechanisms to ensure consistent updates
4. Implement chart-based visualization of simulation results
