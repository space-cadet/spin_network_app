## State Information
- Converted hasHistory to useState in SimulationResultsPanel for better state management
- Improved null-safe evaluations for simulation logs data checks
- Added explicit return type to getDuration in useSimulation fallback handler
- Enhanced state tracking between engine and React components
- Implemented dual refresh mechanism (animation frames + intervals)
- Added data validation before chart rendering
- Created fallback text displays for visualization failures
- Improved dependency tracking in simulation hooks
- Enhanced error handling with better logging
- Implemented simulation pause functionality fixes for consistent behavior
- Improved animation frame management and cleanup
- Added dedicated debug panel with auto-refresh capability
- Enhanced data flow between visualization and simulation engine
- Enhanced conservation data retrieval from multiple sources
- Improved fallback mechanisms when visualizations fail

## Changes Completed
- ✅ Fixed Simulation Pause Functionality
  - Added explicit cancelAnimationFrame calls in pause handler
  - Improved synchronization between React state and engine running state
  - Enhanced cleanup to avoid memory leaks during component unmount
  - Fixed animation loop to correctly check both React and engine states
  
- ✅ Enhanced Simulation Results Display
  - Implemented dual refresh mechanism (animation frames + intervals)
  - Added data validation for chart rendering
  - Created fallback text displays for visualization failures
  - Improved dependency tracking in simulation hooks

- ✅ Added Dedicated Debug Panel
  - Created SimulationDebugPanel component with auto-refresh
  - Integrated as a new tab in the bottom panel
  - Added detailed raw data display for simulation state, graph, and conservation laws
  - Removed embedded debug view from SimulationResultsPanel for cleaner UI

- ✅ Fixed State Management Issues
  - Converted hasHistory to useState in SimulationResultsPanel
