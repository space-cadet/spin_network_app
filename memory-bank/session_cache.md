## Status
CONTINUING

## Current Task
Planning and designing the simulation component for spin network diffusion

## Current Step
Defining core modules and architecture for the simulation component

## Critical Files
- `/memory-bank/implementation-details/mathematical_roadmap.md`
- `/memory-bank/implementation-details/dev_trajectories.md`
- `/memory-bank/activeContext.md`

## State Information
- Selected approach: Modular Incremental Approach (Trajectory 3)
- Identified core utilities and functions needed for simulation
- Updated activeContext.md with simulation component planning
- Next step: Design modular architecture and interfaces

## Implementation Plan Summary
1. Create modular architecture with well-defined interfaces
2. Implement basic graph representation and matrix utilities
3. Build Laplacian operator with configurable weight functions
4. Develop state vector system and basic time evolution
5. Integrate with existing visualization system
6. Progressively enhance with more sophisticated features

## Notes
- Focus on getting minimal working simulation first, then refine
- Design for extensibility to support different mathematical models
- Create clean separation between simulation engine and visualization
- Consider performance optimization for matrix operations
