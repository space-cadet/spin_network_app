## Status
CONTINUING

## Current Task
Fixing simulation component to display real simulation data 

## Current Step
Resolved TypeScript errors and build issues in the simulation component

## Critical Files
- `/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts`
- `/src/components/simulation/SimulationResultsPanel.tsx`
- `/src/simulation/core/engineImplementation.ts`
- `/src/simulation/models/diffusionModels.ts`
- `/src/simulation/index.ts`
- `/src/components/workspace/Workspace.tsx`
- `/src/App.tsx`

## State Information
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors that were preventing the app from loading
- Restructured useSimulation.ts to properly handle function declarations and avoid "used before initialization" errors
- Fixed simulation engine implementation to remove unused references
- Updated visualization components to use real data from the simulation engine
- Added explicit type casting to resolve TypeScript errors in critical components
- Improved error handling and logging in the simulation loop
- Implemented real-time updates for simulation conservation data
- Enhanced console logging for debugging simulation steps
- Properly handled matrix type conversions in diffusion models
- Added status indicators to show when the simulation is running even without full history

## Bug Fixes
1. Fixed TypeScript compilation errors that prevented the app from loading:
   - Resolved "Cannot access 'updateInitialStateParams' before initialization" error in useSimulation hook
   - Fixed "SpinNetworkSimulationEngine is not defined" error in simulation/index.ts
   - Fixed type errors with colorScale and sizeScale in visualization components
   - Resolved Matrix/MathArray type conversion issues in diffusionModels.ts
   - Removed unused variables and imports that were causing build errors
   - Fixed duplicate function declaration issue

2. Enhanced simulation data handling:
   - Made the SimulationResultsPanel show real conservation data
   - Added better error handling in the simulation animation loop
   - Improved visualization state handling for CytoscapeAdapter
   - Fixed immediate state updates when simulation starts
   - Added proper type safety for numerical operations

3. Improved simulation engine implementation:
   - Removed unused NumericalSolver reference in engineImplementation.ts
   - Fixed solver factory usage in the initialize method
   - Added explicit handling of matrix conversions in the diffusion models
   - Added type safety for colorScale and sizeScale arrays

## Design Decisions
- Restructured useSimulation.ts to ensure all function declarations occur before usage
- Used TypeScript type assertions to fix matrix conversion issues
- Added extensive console logging to help debug simulation progress
- Improved simulation control and feedback mechanisms
- Focused on connecting real simulation data to UI display
- Used explicit type casting to resolve TypeScript type errors
- Added defensive coding patterns to handle undefined or null cases
- Implemented type-safe numerical operations throughout the codebase

## Next Steps
1. Resolve any remaining runtime issues with the simulation component
2. Ensure visualization updates properly reflect actual simulation state
3. Add parameter presets for common simulation scenarios
4. Enhance visualization of conservation laws with actual simulation data
5. Implement data export functionality for simulation results
6. Create comprehensive tests for simulation component
7. Consider adding a timeline visualization for simulation history

## Notes
- The app structure is sound but there were several TypeScript errors causing build issues
- The simulation engine is properly implemented but required fixes for type checking
- Current visualization should now reflect actual simulation state
- The restructured useSimulation hook now properly handles all function dependencies
- Console logging has been enhanced to provide better visibility into simulation operations
- Simulation control panel is now more resilient and provides better user feedback
- Real data is being used for conservation law display instead of placeholders
