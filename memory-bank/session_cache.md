## State Information
- Fixed TypeError in useSimulation.ts:28 "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'nodes')"
- Added null checks for network data in useSimulation hook
- Improved SimulationControlPanel to show all controls even when no network is available
- Added a warning banner in the simulation panel when no network is present
- Enhanced SimulationResultsPanel to handle undefined values

- Fixed network state reference in SimulationControlPanel (was using 'present', now using 'currentNetwork')
- Fixed network state reference in useSimulation hook (was using 'present', now using 'currentNetwork')
- Updated copyright message in MainLayout.tsx from "© 2023" to "© Deepak Vaid, 2025"
- Discovered that simulation visualization and logging features are already implemented
- Workspace component correctly integrates with CytoscapeAdapter for visualization 
- SimulationLogsPanel provides comprehensive logging UI with filtering and export capabilities
- simulationLogger singleton captures all simulation events, parameter changes, and results
- App UI provides tabs for switching between results and logs in the bottom panel
- Made SimulationControlPanel collapsible with a toggle button
- Improved tab interface for "Parameters" and "Analysis" sections
- Added status indicators that remain visible even when the panel is collapsed

## Bug Fixes
1. Fixed error in useSimulation hook when accessing network.nodes and network is undefined
   - Added optional chaining and null checks
   - Added fallback empty array when nodes array is undefined
2. Improved SimulationControlPanel user experience
   - Added warning banner when no network is available instead of hiding controls
   - Disabled execution buttons when no network is available
   - Kept all parameter controls visible and configurable
   - Made the panel collapsible to save space when not in use
   - Improved tab interface with better visual cues
3. Enhanced SimulationResultsPanel to safely handle undefined values
   - Added default values for all parameters
   - Used optional chaining for accessing nested properties
4. Fixed "No network detected" warning appearing even when network is present
   - Updated the Redux selector to correctly check state.network.currentNetwork instead of state.network.present
5. Updated copyright in footer
   - Changed from "© 2023" to "© Deepak Vaid, 2025"
6. Properly connected simulation visualization to the main workspace
   - Integrated CytoscapeAdapter with the Workspace component to update node styles
   - Added effect hook to update visualization when simulation state changes
7. Ensured simulation logger properly captures events
   - Added logging for simulation start, pause, reset, and parameter changes
   - Implemented regular logging of conservation results during simulation

## Design Decisions
- Kept all simulation controls visible even when no network is available
- Added warning banner instead of hiding functionality
- Added contextual disabling of buttons to indicate what requires a network
- Used defensive coding approach throughout the components
- Implemented non-intrusive feedback about requirements for simulation
- Made components resilient to undefined or null Redux state
- Created a tabbed interface in the bottom panel to separate results and logs
- Made simulation control panel collapsible to improve workspace efficiency
- Added status indication in the header when panel is collapsed
- Improved tab interface with better visual styling and clearer separation
- Implemented a comprehensive logging system with:
  - Session management for maintaining history of simulation runs
  - Filtering by log level and text content
  - Event tracking for parameter changes and simulation actions
  - Export functionality for log data
- Used a singleton pattern for the simulation logger to ensure consistent access

## Next Steps
1. Connect real conservation law data to the SimulationResultsPanel
2. Create data visualizations for simulation analysis (charts, plots)
3. Enhance reporting of geometric properties in the results panel
4. Add more statistical analysis capabilities to the results panel
5. Implement parameter presets for common simulation scenarios
6. Add import/export functionality for simulation configurations
7. Create comprehensive tests for simulation component and UI
8. Add visualization of simulation history with timeline scrubbing
9. Consider adding a compact view mode for the simulation controls

## Notes
- The improved design allows users to configure simulation parameters even before having a network
- Warning banners provide clear feedback without hiding functionality
- Visual disabling of buttons provides intuitive indication of what requires a network
- The simulation visualization successfully updates node colors and sizes based on state
- The logging system provides comprehensive tracking of simulation events
- User can view, filter, and export simulation logs
- Simulation results currently use placeholder data instead of actual simulation results
- Need to connect the real conservation law data from the simulation engine to the UI
- Current visualization changes reflect simulation state but could be enhanced with animations
- The collapsible simulation panel helps maximize workspace area when needed
- Status indicators remain visible in the panel header even when collapsed
- Improved tab interface makes switching between parameters and analysis more intuitive
