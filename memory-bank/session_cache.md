## Current Task
Implementing database solution for logs, simulations, and graphs

## Current Step
Implementing LogViewerAdapter with PrimeReact and Redux integration

- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/store/index.ts

## State Information
- ‚úÖ Created database configuration with Dexie.js
- ‚úÖ Implemented comprehensive database schema for logs, simulations, and graphs
- ‚úÖ Created service classes with full CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Implemented migration utilities for existing markdown logs
- ‚úÖ Added LogService with advanced querying and export functionality
- ‚úÖ Created Redux integration for logs with async thunks
- ‚úÖ Implemented LogViewerAdapter component with PrimeReact DataTable
- üîÑ Fixing LogViewerAdapter issues and Redux integration
- ‚òê Add CSS imports for PrimeReact in main entry file
- ‚òê Update App.tsx to include log viewer in UI
- ‚òê Test migration of existing logs into database

## Next Steps
1. Fix LogViewerAdapter component:
   - Add missing interface definition
   - Connect to Redux state instead of local state
   - Fix missing function declarations
   - Add proper error handling

2. Complete Redux integration:
   - Update store/index.ts to include logsSlice
   - Connect LogViewerAdapter to Redux state and actions

3. Update main application:
   - Add PrimeReact CSS imports
   - Add route or tab for log viewer
   - Test log viewer with migrated log data

4. Migrate existing logs:
   - Create utility to import from errorLog.md and edit_history.md
   - Run migration and verify data integrity

## Implemented Features
- Database schema design with Dexie.js
- Log entry models with specialized types for errors and edits
- Advanced log querying with filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Migration utilities for existing markdown logs
- Export capabilities for logs (JSON and Markdown formats)
- Redux integration with async thunks
- PrimeReact DataTable integration for log viewing

## Known Issues to Fix
1. Missing LogViewerAdapterProps interface in LogViewerAdapter
2. Component using local state instead of Redux store
3. Missing function declarations in LogViewerAdapter
4. Missing PrimeReact CSS imports
5. Missing connection to Redux in logs slice
6. Need to add logs reducer to main Redux store
7. Need to integrate LogViewerAdapter into main application

## Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Database configuration and schema
- ‚úÖ Log service implementation
- ‚úÖ Redux slice for logs
- üîÑ LogViewerAdapter UI component
- ‚òê Integration with main application
- ‚òê Migration of existing logs
