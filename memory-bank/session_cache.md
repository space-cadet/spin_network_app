## Status
CONTINUING

## Current Task
Fixing simulation play/pause functionality and LogViewerAdapter component

## Current Step
Debugging and fixing remaining issues with simulation animation

## State Information
- ‚úÖ Fixed LogViewerAdapter component by adding missing useState import
- ‚úÖ Fixed controlled/uncontrolled input warnings in MultiSelect component
- ‚úÖ Fixed circular dependency in useReduxSimulation.ts
- ‚úÖ Improved animation loop in useSimulation.ts for better pause/play behavior
- ‚úÖ Reduced excessive console logging
- ‚úÖ Enhanced synchronization between engine state and React state
- üîÑ Debugging play/pause functionality to ensure it stops correctly
- üîÑ Ensuring simulation data is properly synchronized with Redux
- ‚òê Fix remaining issues with simulation animation
- ‚òê Test changes thoroughly with various network configurations

## Next Steps
1. Continue debugging simulation play/pause functionality:
   - Check for any remaining animation frame leaks
   - Verify that Redux state stays in sync with simulation engine
   - Analyze whether UI updates reflect the actual simulation state

2. Implement additional safeguards for state synchronization:
   - Add more robust checks for engine state before operations
   - Implement better cleanup mechanisms for animation frames
   - Create proper feedback to users when simulation state changes

3. Consider refactoring the simulation state management:
   - Explore whether to use a more functional approach to state updates
   - Investigate moving animation loop management to its own hook
   - Consider separating concerns more clearly in the simulation code

## Implemented Fixes
- Fixed LogViewerAdapter component by adding missing useState import
- Fixed controlled/uncontrolled input warnings in MultiSelect component
- Fixed circular dependency in useReduxSimulation.ts by reordering function declarations
- Improved animation loop in useSimulation.ts with better state checking
- Added proper animation frame cleanup on pause/unmount
- Reduced excessive console logging for better performance
- Enhanced synchronization between engine state and React state
- Fixed error with syncSimulationDataToRedux function usage

## Known Issues to Fix
1. Simulation play/pause functionality still not working perfectly
2. Animation sometimes continues after pause button is clicked
3. Potential memory leaks due to uncleared animation frames
4. Excessive re-renders during simulation may affect performance

## Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Fixed LogViewerAdapter React errors
- ‚úÖ Fixed controlled/uncontrolled input warnings
- ‚úÖ Fixed circular dependency in useReduxSimulation
- ‚úÖ Improved animation loop implementation
- üîÑ Debugging simulation play/pause functionality
- üîÑ Working on state synchronization issues
