## Implementation Details

### Fixed Simulation Rendering Loops and Stability Issues

1. **Resolved "Too many re-renders" error**
   - Fixed useRef hooks being used improperly inside useEffect callbacks
   - Created dedicated TimePointsDisplay component with proper React.memo optimization
   - Updated getHistory function to prevent state updates on every call
   - Added throttling mechanisms for frequent function calls
   - Used static properties to track state update history

2. **Fixed infinite console logging loop**
   - Added timestamp-based throttling for log messages
   - Implemented static property tracking to prevent redundant warnings
   - Created ref-based data structure for debug information instead of console logs
   - Added controlled refresh cycle to prevent excessive logging
   - Limited log frequency to once per second for recurring operations

3. **Improved React patterns and performance**
   - Moved all hook declarations to the top level of components
   - Added proper dependencies to useEffect and useCallback hooks
   - Created specialized components for data-intensive operations
   - Implemented intervals instead of render-time operations for data fetching
   - Added proper cleanup for intervals and timers in unmount handlers

### Redux Integration for Simulation State

1. **Created core simulation Redux slice**
   - Defined state interfaces for geometric, statistical, and conservation data
   - Implemented actions for all simulation operations
   - Set up persistence configuration for relevant simulation data

2. **Developed useReduxSimulation hook**
   - Combined existing useSimulation hook with Redux state management
   - Added synchronization mechanism between simulation engine and Redux
   - Ensured proper handling of simulation timepoints and data

3. **Refactored UI components**
   - Updated SimulationResultsPanel to use Redux state
   - Removed duplicate state tracking and calculation logic
   - Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Added improved debugging and logging

4. **Enhanced test-simulation.js**
   - Added better error handling and result collection
   - Improved logging of geometric properties and statistics
   - Created helper to update UI with simulation results
   - Ensured all calculations have proper fallbacks

## Next Steps
- Begin refactoring large component files
- Break down SimulationResultsPanel.tsx into smaller components
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Improve performance with more targeted rendering
