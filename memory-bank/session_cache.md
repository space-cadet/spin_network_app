## Status
COMPLETE

## Current Task
1. Move Application Logs panel to same level as Simulation Logs panel
2. Fix infinite update loop issues in simulation components

## Current Steps Completed
- ✅ Added Application Logs as a top-level tab in the bottom panel
- ✅ Simplified UI structure by removing redundant EnhancedLogsPanel
- ✅ Fixed Maximum update depth exceeded error in SimulationControlPanel
- ✅ Fixed time slider update issues in simulation
- ✅ Fixed React update cycle issues in useReduxSimulation hook

## State Information
### UI Improvements
- Application Logs panel is now accessible directly as a top-level tab
- Removed unnecessary EnhancedLogsPanel component
- Simplified component structure for better maintainability

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed infinite update loop issues by implementing proper React state management
- Added protection against re-entrancy in simulation hooks
- Fixed time comparison bug in animation loop that prevented time slider updates
- Replaced setInterval with setTimeout for better control over sync timing
- Added rate limiting to prevent excessive state updates

## Next Steps
- Test log rotation and migration utilities with large datasets
- Refactor large simulation components for maintainability
- Enhance analysis tools for simulation results

## Known Issues to Monitor
- Warning about "Insufficient sample size for regression" during early simulation
- Warning about "getCurrentState: State exists but has no data" during initialization
