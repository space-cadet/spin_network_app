## Status
CONTINUING

## Current Task
Fixing simulation functionality issues

## Current Step
Added dedicated debug panel and fixed pause functionality

## State Information
- Fixed pause button functionality to properly stop the simulation
- Added dedicated debug panel as a separate tab in the bottom panel
- Improved animation loop to check both React state and engine state
- Enhanced error handling and logging in the simulation engine
- Added explicit animation frame cancellation in pause function
- Removed embedded debug view from results panel
- Added raw data display components for fallback when visualizations fail
- Fixed TypeScript errors in the new components

## Next Steps
- Address the auto-refresh issue for simulation panels
- Fix the issue with results panel not displaying charts
- Improve error detection for "Simulation not running" issue
- Add more detailed logging for simulation state detection
- Update the refresh mechanism for simulation panels
- Look into potential timing issues with simulation data availability
- Consider adding a polling mechanism for more reliable updates
