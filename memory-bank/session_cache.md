## Status
CONTINUING

## Current Task
Abstract out the simulation functionality from the UI component to create standalone libraries that users could import into their code to run simulations on spin networks.

## Current Step
Planning the abstraction structure and implementation approach.

## State Information
### Plan Overview
Created a detailed plan to abstract the simulation functionality into standalone libraries:

1. Create a new `lib` directory with modular structure:
   - `lib/core` - Core simulation functionality
   - `lib/models` - Diffusion models and solvers
   - `lib/analysis` - Analysis tools
   - `lib/adapters` - Visualization adapters
   - `lib/utils` - Utility functions

2. Designed a clean API for the library with:
   - Factory functions for easy instantiation
   - Clear type definitions
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Optional visualization adapters

3. Implementation phases:
   - Phase 1: Set up directory structure and package configuration
   - Phase 2: Move core simulation logic with updated interfaces
   - Phase 3: Move and refactor models and analysis tools
   - Phase 4: Set up proper entry points and API
   - Phase 5: Add documentation and usage examples
   - Phase 6: Test library and fix any issues
   - Phase 7: Refactor original app to use the new library

4. Documentation approach defined for README, JSDoc, and usage guides

5. Architectural considerations identified:
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Optional visualization
   - Clean interfaces
   - Type safety
   - Error handling
   - Performance
   - Extensibility

### Implementation Status
- ✅ Analyzed current codebase structure and dependencies
- ✅ Created detailed abstraction plan
- ✅ Defined new library structure
- ✅ Designed library API
- ✅ Developed usage examples
- ⬜ Set up directory structure and package configuration
- ⬜ Move core simulation logic
- ⬜ Move models and analysis tools
- ⬜ Create proper entry points and API
- ⬜ Add documentation
- ⬜ Test library
- ⬜ Refactor original app

## Next Steps
1. Create the new directory structure
2. Set up package configuration for the library
3. Begin moving core simulation logic to the new structure
4. Update imports and exports to ensure proper module structure
5. Remove UI dependencies from the core code

## Design Decisions
- Maintain full backward compatibility with the existing app
- Keep visualization adapters optional to reduce dependencies
- Separate the core simulation logic from UI-specific code
- Design for easy extensibility with new models and solvers
- Use factory functions for a clean API

## Notes
The complete abstraction plan has been saved to the project-brief and implementation-details directories for reference. The implementation will proceed in phases with careful testing to ensure nothing breaks in the existing application while we extract the simulation functionality.
