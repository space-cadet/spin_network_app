## Status
CONTINUING

## Current Task
Implementing the simulation component for spin network diffusion

## Current Step
Building core simulation infrastructure with existing libraries

## Critical Files
- `/src/simulation/core/types.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/stateVector.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/graph.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/mathAdapter.ts`
- `/src/simulation/models/weightFunctions.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/simulation-plan.md`

## State Information
- Selected approach: Modular Incremental Approach using existing libraries
- Decided to leverage math.js for matrix operations instead of building from scratch
- Implemented core interfaces and initial classes for simulation component
- Created math.js adapter for mathematical operations
- Created state vector implementation and graph model
- Next step: Complete diffusion models and time evolution engine

## Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Created directory structure for simulation component
2. âœ… Implemented core interfaces in types.ts
3. âœ… Created simulation-plan.md with revised approach leveraging existing libraries
4. âœ… Implemented math.js adapter for matrix operations
5. âœ… Built state vector implementation for simulation state
6. âœ… Implemented graph model for network representation
7. âœ… Created weight function factory for different edge weight calculations
8. ðŸ”„ Started implementing diffusion models
9. â¬œ Implement time evolution engine and visualization adapters

## Design Decisions
- Using math.js for matrix operations and numerical methods
- Creating visualization-agnostic models to support both Cytoscape.js and future three.js
- Implementing immutable data structures for state safety
- Supporting both 2D and 3D network representations with a common interface
- Designing with future extensibility for different diffusion models

## Notes
- Simulation component is being designed for compatibility with future three.js 3D visualization
- Clean separation between simulation logic and visualization allows for multiple visualization approaches
- Core utilities like mathAdapter.ts provide reusable mathematical operations
- Weight functions are configurable to support different physical interpretations of spin networks
