## Status
CONTINUING

## Current Task
Fixed simulation test and enhanced simulation results panel

## Current Step
Added debugging and fixed simulation results panel display issues

## State Information
- Successfully fixed test simulation execution
- Identified and fixed SimulationResultsPanel not showing data
- Added robust debugging to trace simulation data flow
- Enhanced useSimulation hook with additional access methods
- Integrated real-time data from analysis modules
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Added extensive logging to diagnose issues
- Improved refresh mechanism for simulation results

## Next Steps
- Continue debugging the simulation results panel
- Verify that the analysis modules are correctly calculating data
- Add proper loading states for simulation data
- Improve visualization in the results panel with charts
- Consider adding automated tests for the analysis modules
- Add data validation to ensure calculation integrity
