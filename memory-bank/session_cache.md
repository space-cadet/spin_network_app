## Status
CONTINUING

## Current Task
Fixing test-simulation.html to display simulation results

## Current Step
Enhanced error handling and debugging in simulation test files

## Critical Files
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/simulation/index.js
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/test-simulation.js
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/public/test-simulation.html

## State Information
- Fixed "Identifier 'initialState' has already been declared" error in test-simulation.js
- Added bridge index.js file to properly handle JavaScript imports 
- Enhanced error handling in test-simulation.html
- Added detailed logging to track execution flow and debug issues
- Implemented improved error diagnostics for simulation results panel
- Added additional verification for global engine and graph references
- Enhanced logging for simulation component calculations

## Changes Completed
- ✅ Fixed duplicate variable declaration
  - Removed duplicate initialization of `initialState` in test-simulation.js
  - Added comment to clarify state initialization flow

- ✅ Created JavaScript bridge file
  - Added src/simulation/index.js to expose TypeScript components
  - Directly exported critical components with specific imports
  - Added debugging logs to verify component availability

- ✅ Enhanced error handling
  - Added detailed error reporting in updateResultsPanel function
  - Added step-by-step logging to track calculation flow
  - Added verification of global engine and graph references
  - Added error handling for dynamic imports
  - Improved console output with more descriptive messages

- ✅ Added Debugging Enhancements
  - Implemented verification of window.currentEngine and window.currentGraph
  - Added try/catch blocks around critical calculations
  - Added detailed property logging for state and graph objects
  - Enhanced timeout handling for asynchronous operations
  - Added stack trace reporting for exceptions

## Next Steps
- Test the improved code to see if the simulation results are displayed
- Further investigate any remaining issues with calculations
- Consider implementing additional visualization of simulation state
- Add proper error recovery mechanisms for calculation failures
- Improve the simulation state display with dynamic updates
