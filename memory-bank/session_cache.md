## Status
COMPLETE

## Current Task
Fixing simulation results not displaying in panels

## Current Step
Fixed data flow between simulation engine and results panel

## Critical Files
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/components/simulation/SimulationResultsPanel.tsx
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/simulation/core/engineImplementation.ts
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/simulation/core/simulationLogger.ts

## State Information
- Fixed error in detecting simulation history
- Added proper history retrieval with error handling
- Enhanced data persistence between simulation runs
- Connected simulation logs as fallback data source
- Added explicit history flag update after first simulation step
- Enhanced data validation before rendering
- Improved state tracking between engine and UI
- Fixed graph initialization and validation
- Added more detailed logging for debugging
- Added fallback displays and data validation
- Fixed history detection in useSimulation hook
- Added new getHistory method to useSimulation API
- Enhanced conservation data retrieval from multiple sources

## Changes Completed
- ✅ Added Graph State Initialization
  - Added validation checks for graph data
  - Enhanced logging for graph creation
  - Fixed node initialization issues
- ✅ Fixed History Tracking
  - Added explicit history tracking flags
  - Fixed detection of timepoints in history
  - Added better error handling for history access
- ✅ Connected Log Data to Visualization
  - Created direct data path from logs to visualization
  - Added SimulationLogger as fallback data source
  - Enhanced conservation data retrieval
- ✅ Added Data Persistence Between Runs
  - Ensured state persists after simulation stops
  - Added caching of simulation states
  - Implemented fallback to logs when state is missing

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing real-time charts with proper data binding
- Add visualization of history data with timeline selection
- Enhance chart displays with interactive elements
- Improve data export capabilities for analysis
- Add more detailed diagnostics for simulation state
