## Status
COMPLETE

## Current Task
Fixed simulation play/pause functionality, Redux synchronization, and LogViewerAdapter issues

## Current Step
All critical issues with simulation play/pause, Redux sync, and LogViewerAdapter are now fixed. Documentation and memory-bank files updated.

## Critical Files
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/hooks/useReduxSimulation.ts
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/components/logs/LogViewerAdapter.tsx
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/memory-bank/edit_history.md
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/memory-bank/errorLog.md
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/memory-bank/activeContext.md

## State Information
- ✅ Fixed LogViewerAdapter component by adding missing useState import
- ✅ Fixed controlled/uncontrolled input warnings in MultiSelect component
- ✅ Fixed circular dependency in useReduxSimulation.ts
- ✅ Improved animation loop in useSimulation.ts for better pause/play behavior
- ✅ Reduced excessive console logging
- ✅ Enhanced synchronization between engine state and React state
- ✅ Simulation play/pause and Redux sync issues are now fixed

## Next Steps
- Test log rotation and migration utilities with large datasets
- Refactor large simulation components for maintainability
- Enhance analysis tools for simulation results

## Implemented Fixes
- Fixed LogViewerAdapter component by adding missing useState import
- Fixed controlled/uncontrolled input warnings in MultiSelect component
- Fixed circular dependency in useReduxSimulation.ts by reordering function declarations
- Improved animation loop in useSimulation.ts with better state checking
- Added proper animation frame cleanup on pause/unmount
- Reduced excessive console logging for better performance
- Enhanced synchronization between engine state and React state
- Fixed error with syncSimulationDataToRedux function usage
- Simulation play/pause and Redux sync issues are now fixed

## Known Issues to Fix
- None (all critical issues for this session are resolved)
