## Status
COMPLETE

## Current Task
Fixing simulation functionality issues

## Current Step
Fixed auto-refresh issues and chart visualization in the simulation results panel

## Critical Files

- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/components/simulation/SimulationDebugPanel.tsx
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/components/simulation/RawDataDisplay.tsx

- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/components/simulation/index.ts

## State Information
- Fixed pause button functionality to properly stop the simulation
- Added dedicated debug panel as a separate tab in the bottom panel
- Improved animation loop to check both React state and engine state
- Enhanced error handling and logging in the simulation engine
- Added explicit animation frame cancellation in pause function
- Removed embedded debug view from results panel
- Added raw data display components for fallback when visualizations fail
- Fixed TypeScript errors in the new components
- Implemented dual refresh mechanism (interval + animation frame) for more reliable updates
- Added enhanced data validation before chart rendering
- Implemented fallback displays for all charts when visualization fails
- Improved refresh logic to detect simulation state changes
- Added additional polling for simulation availability detection
- Enhanced error detection with better logging
- Improved dependency arrays in useEffect hooks to prevent stale data

## Changes Completed
- ✅ Create a Dedicated Debug Panel (completed in previous step)
- ✅ Fix Auto-Refresh Issues
  - Added dual refresh mechanism with both interval and animation frame
  - Improved dependency arrays to detect all relevant state changes
  - Added polling for simulation availability detection
  - Enhanced error logging and diagnostics
- ✅ Fix Chart Visualization
  - Added data validation before visualization attempts
  - Implemented fallback displays for all charts
  - Enhanced error detection and handling
  - Added direct access to simulation data in the component
  - Improved state detection logic for conditional rendering

## Next Steps
For future improvements:
- Consider implementing proper chart components using a charting library
- Add persistent history tracking to allow viewing past simulation runs
- Implement export functionality for simulation results
- Add more detailed analytics for the simulation results
- Consider adding real-time collaboration features
