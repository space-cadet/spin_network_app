## Design Decisions
- Using math.js for matrix operations and numerical methods
- Creating visualization-agnostic models to support both Cytoscape.js and future three.js
- Implementing immutable data structures for state safety
- Supporting both 2D and 3D network representations with a common interface
- Designing with future extensibility for different diffusion models
- Implementing multiple numerical solvers with different accuracy/performance tradeoffs
- Providing comprehensive analysis tools for geometric properties and conservation laws
- Creating a clear separation between simulation logic and visualization
- Using factory patterns for creating model instances (solvers, diffusion models, etc.)
- Keeping core state immutable for better predictability and debugging
- Using adapter pattern for visualization integration to allow future visualization methods

## Notes
- Simulation component is being designed for compatibility with future three.js 3D visualization
- Clean separation between simulation logic and visualization allows for multiple visualization approaches
- Core utilities like mathAdapter.ts provide reusable mathematical operations
- Weight functions are configurable to support different physical interpretations of spin networks
- The analysis tools provide quantum geometric insights into the simulation behavior
- Each diffusion model can be configured with different parameters and numerical solvers
- The CytoscapeAdapter provides direct integration with the existing visualization
- Next session will focus on UI integration to expose simulation capabilities to users
