## Active Tasks

### T9: Fix UI and Simulation TypeScript Errors
**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** 2025-04-15
**Last Active:** 2025-04-15 15:30 IST
**Dependencies:** -

#### Context
Fixing TypeScript errors in UI components, hooks, and simulation code that are preventing the application from building successfully. These errors are primarily related to type safety issues in components and simulation code.

#### Critical Files
- `/src/App.tsx`
- `/src/components/logs/LogViewerAdapter.tsx` 
- `/src/components/simulation/SimulationResultsPanel.tsx`
- `/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/engineImplementation.ts`
- `/src/store/slices/logsSlice.ts`
- `/src/utils/logMigrationUtil.ts`
- `/src/types/simulation.d.ts` (may need to create)

#### Implementation Progress
1. ✅ Fix error handling in App.tsx and logMigrationUtil.ts
2. ✅ Fix prop type issues in LogViewerAdapter.tsx
3. ✅ Resolve property access on empty objects in SimulationResultsPanel.tsx
4. ✅ Fix type compatibility issues in state objects
5. ✅ Fix null safety issues in engineImplementation.ts (added null checks in multiple locations)
6. ✅ Resolve missing type definitions in useSimulation.ts
7. ✅ Fix hasWarnedNull property issues in useSimulation.ts
8. ✅ Fix boolean/undefined type error in SimulationResultsPanel.tsx
9. ✅ Fix void/number comparison in simulationService.ts
10. 🔄 Validate build success (several issues fixed, some remaining)

#### Working State
Made significant progress in fixing TypeScript errors across the application:

1. Added explicit type assertions in useSimulation.ts to fix SimulationParameters type compatibility issues, using `as unknown as` pattern to safely bridge import types
2. Fixed null safety issues in engineImplementation.ts by adding null assertion operators and guarding property access with conditional checks
3. Fixed boolean type handling in SimulationResultsPanel.tsx to ensure fromLogs is always a boolean
4. Improved void/number comparison in simulationService.ts to properly handle the Dexie result type

Some TypeScript errors still remain, but we've significantly reduced their number. The focus continues to be on addressing type safety issues while maintaining the existing functionality.

### T8: Implement Edit History File Rotation

**Dependencies:** T7

#### Context
Implemented file rotation for edit_history.md which had grown too large (830 lines, exceeding the 500-line threshold). This follows the size-based rotation protocol specified in Section 3.6 of the Integrated Code Rules and the detailed log rotation protocol in implementation-details.

#### Critical Files
- `/memory-bank/edit_history.md`
- `/memory-bank/archive/edit_history_2025-04.md`

2. ✅ Extract header and recent entries from April 14-15, 2025
3. ✅ Copy original edit_history.md to archive location with dated filename
4. ✅ Create new edit_history.md with header and recent entries
5. ✅ Update edit_history.md with the rotation entry
6. ✅ Update tasks.md and session_cache.md

#### Working State
Successfully implemented the file rotation system for the edit_history.md file, preserving the entries from April 14-15, 2025 while archiving the older entries to `/memory-bank/archive/edit_history_2025-04.md`. 

Key statistics:
- Original file: 47385 bytes, 830 lines
- Rotated file: 7748 bytes, 110 lines
- Reduction: 39637 bytes (84% smaller)

This rotation preserves recent development history while keeping the file at a manageable size. The rotation complied with the Memory Bank Size Management Protocol from Section 3.6 of the Integrated Code Rules.

#### Context
Implemented file rotation for errorLog.md which had grown too large (> 2000 lines). This follows the size-based rotation protocol specified in Section 3.6 of the Integrated Code Rules.

#### Critical Files
- `/memory-bank/errorLog.md`
- `/memory-bank/archive/errorLog_2025-04.md`
- `/memory-bank/edit_history.md`

#### Implementation Progress
1. ✅ Verify current size of errorLog.md and archive directory
2. ✅ Extract header and recent entries from errorLog.md
3. ✅ Move original errorLog.md to archive location with dated filename
4. ✅ Create new errorLog.md with header and recent entries
5. ✅ Update edit_history.md with the changes
6. ✅ Register and complete task in tasks.md

#### Working State
Successfully implemented the file rotation system for the errorLog.md file, preserving the 5 most recent error entries while archiving the older entries to `/memory-bank/archive/errorLog_2025-04.md`. Used command-line tools to minimize token usage and avoid loading the entire large file.

Key steps completed:
- Verified errorLog.md was ~80KB in size
- Extracted header and last 5 error entries
- Archived original file to `/memory-bank/archive/errorLog_2025-04.md`

#### Critical Files
- `/memory-bank/edit_history.md`
- `/memory-bank/archive/edit_history_2025-04.md`
- `/memory-bank/tasks.md`
- `/memory-bank/session_cache.md`
