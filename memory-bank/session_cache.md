#### Working State
Enhanced intertwiner space implementation with significant improvements and made educational content more accessible:

1. **Order Dependence Documentation**:
   - Added comprehensive explanation of why different orderings of the same spins can yield different dimensions
   - Documented the mathematical theory behind recoupling schemes and their physical meaning
   - Provided detailed examples showing how different permutations affect the calculation
   - Created clear diagrams and equations to explain the phenomenon

   - Structured the content into logical subsections (basic concepts, dimension calculation, etc.)
   - Added implementation notes including the bug fix information from the error log
   - Ensured proper integration with the notebook's TOC and navigation system
   - Updated all subsequent section numbers to maintain proper sequence

The enhanced implementation now properly addresses the subtle but important issue that different recoupling schemes can yield different intertwiner dimensions even for the same set of spins, and provides multiple approaches to handle this in calculations. The bug fix ensures that all dimension calculations follow proper angular momentum physics.

### T10: Standalone Test Page for Simulation Library
**Status:** üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** 2025-04-15
**Last Active:** 2025-04-16 07:45 IST
**Dependencies:** T1

#### Context
Created a standalone HTML test page that demonstrates the functionality of the simulation library without requiring the full React application. Fixed issues with simulation execution and UI feedback.

#### Critical Files
- `/public/standalone-test.html` - HTML structure with controls and visualization
- `/public/standalone-test.js` - JavaScript implementation for simulation control
- `/lib-bundle.config.js` - Vite configuration for bundling the library
- `/package.json` - Updated with build:lib script

#### Implementation Progress
1. ‚úÖ Create HTML page with basic structure, controls, and visualization container
2. ‚úÖ Implement JavaScript for graph creation with sample nodes and edges
3. ‚úÖ Add simulation initialization and control (run/pause/reset)
4. ‚úÖ Implement canvas-based visualization for network and states
5. ‚úÖ Add metrics calculation (volume, area, dimension, entropy)
6. ‚úÖ Create build configuration for library bundling
7. ‚úÖ Fix simulation execution by adding steps to animation loop
8. ‚úÖ Fix infinite logging issue after simulation completion
9. ‚úÖ Add better handling for numerical instability with exponential formatting
10. ‚úÖ Optimize animation loop to maintain proper update frequency
11. ‚¨ú Add more interactive controls
12. ‚¨ú Enhance visualization with more data views
13. ‚¨ú Add parameter adjustment interface

#### Working State
Successfully implemented and fixed the standalone test page for the simulation library. The page now correctly:

1. Creates a sample spin network with 5 nodes and 6 edges
2. Runs a diffusion simulation on the network with proper step execution
3. Visualizes the network and state evolution through a canvas visualization
4. Updates metrics calculated from the simulation (volume, area, dimension, entropy)
5. Handles large numbers using exponential notation
6. Properly terminates logging after simulation completion
7. Provides detailed node-by-node state information at the end

The main issue was that the animation loop was not actually executing simulation steps - it was just updating the UI. Now it correctly runs 5 steps per frame for smoother simulation progress. There's still some numerical stability issues to address in the future, but the core functionality is working.
