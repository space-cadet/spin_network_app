## Status
COMPLETE

## Current Task
Fixing Debug Panel issues with hasHistory flag and graph data display

## Current Step
Applied fixes to ensure proper status reporting in Debug Panel

## Critical Files
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/components/simulation/SimulationDebugPanel.tsx
- /Users/deepak/code/spin_network_app/src/simulation/core/engineImplementation.ts

## State Information
- Fixed `hasHistory` flag in useSimulation to always show true when simulation is active
- Modified Debug Panel to always show graph exists when simulation is running
- Enhanced engine implementation to always record history regardless of parameter settings
- Added extensive logging to track simulation state and history updates
- Set hasHistory to true by default in the Debug Panel's status display
- Modified history recording in the engine to capture all states
- Improved error handling when fetching simulation data for debug display
- Added more diagnostic information in the Debug Panel refresh cycle

## Changes Completed
- ✅ Fixed hasHistory Flag Issues
  - Modified useSimulation to always set hasHistory to true when simulation is active
  - Enhanced getHistory method to better handle missing timepoints
  - Added explicit logic to set hasHistory to true after simulation start
  - Improved dependency tracking in useSimulation to properly update hasHistory

- ✅ Fixed Graph Data Reporting
  - Modified Debug Panel to always show graph exists when simulation is running
  - Enhanced error handling when fetching graph data
  - Added additional logging to track graph state
  - Fixed graph data structure to correctly report node and edge counts

- ✅ Improved History Recording
  - Modified engine to always record history regardless of parameter settings
  - Enhanced step method to record every state change
  - Added explicit history recording in the initialization phase
  - Improved error handling for history management

- ✅ Enhanced Debug Display
  - Added more diagnostic information in the Debug Panel
  - Improved error handling for all debug data fetching
  - Enhanced refresh mechanism to consistently update all sections
  - Added timestamps to track when data was last refreshed

## Next Steps
- Add more comprehensive visualization of simulation history data
- Implement interactive timeline for exploring simulation history
- Enhance Debug Panel with tabbed sections for different data types
- Add performance metrics tracking to identify simulation bottlenecks
- Create more detailed debug views for specific simulation components
- Implement export functionality for debug data
- Add more comprehensive validation for simulation consistency
