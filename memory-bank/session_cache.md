6. ✅ Add support for different edge spin values
7. 🔄 Test initialization with different network topologies
8. 🔄 Verify functionality in the tensor-sandbox.html test page

#### Working State
Successfully implemented core tensor initialization functionality:

1. **Created dedicated tensor module**:
   - Implemented `tensorNode.js` with proper tensor initialization logic
   - Created `index.ts` to export enhanced functionality
   - Connected with existing intertwiner space calculations

2. **Tensor initialization implementation**:
   - Added functions to properly calculate tensor elements based on intertwiner values
   - Implemented specialized functions for 2-valent, 3-valent, and 4-valent nodes
   - Ensured correct handling of different spin values
   - Fixed syntax error in core tensor.ts file that was causing build issues

3. **Integration with adapter and sandbox**:
   - Updated adapter to directly use library functions instead of storing references
   - Enhanced sandbox to calculate proper dimensions based on edge spins
   - Added helper function for consistent network creation

There are still some issues with the adapter in the tensor sandbox that need to be addressed. The core implementation is working correctly, but the connection between the library and the sandbox needs further refinement.

Next steps:

#### Working State
Successfully created the tensor sandbox environment and fixed critical issues:

1. **Fixed Critical Error**:
   - Identified and fixed the "window.SpinNetwork.createTensorNode is not a function" error
   - The issue was that tensor-bridge.js (which defines the SpinNetwork object with tensor functions) wasn't being loaded
   - Added the missing script tag to tensor-sandbox.html to load tensor-bridge.js after the UMD library

2. **Enhanced Network Options**:
   - Added a "Lattice Network" option to create nodes with higher valence (4-valent)
   - This allows creating nodes with dimensions [2, 2, 2, 2] which enables non-zero intertwiner tensor components
   - Implemented proper grid layout for lattice networks with horizontal and vertical connections

6. 🔄 Fix Markdown header ID anchors displaying as `{#anchor-name}`
7. 🔄 Create consistent module loading strategy for documentation
8. ⬜ Bundle required UMD libraries to correct locations

#### Working State
Made significant progress on addressing documentation issues:

1. **Script Loading Issues**:
   - ✅ FIXED: Updated the UMD library path in standalone-guide.html from an absolute path `/dist/lib/spin-network.umd.js` to a relative path `../../dist/lib/spin-network.umd.js`
   - This resolves the script loading failures in the standalone guide by correctly referencing the library location relative to the document

2. **Routing Problems**:
   - ✅ FIXED: Added `public/_redirects` configuration for SPA routing
   - Added rule: `/*    /index.html   200` that redirects all routes to index.html with a 200 status code
   - This prevents 404 errors when refreshing documentation pages and allows proper back/forward navigation

3. **HTML Processing Improvements**:
   - ✅ FIXED: Enhanced DocsViewer.tsx with better handling of HTML content
   - Improved base path handling for HTML files
   - Added more efficient inclusion of KaTeX styling
   - Fixed paragraph rendering with proper anchor pattern detection

4. **Module Import Issues in simulation-test.html**:
   - 🔄 IN PROGRESS: Significantly simplified the simulation-test.html implementation
   - Replaced the complex module importing mechanism with direct window.SpinNetwork access
   - Updated all functions to use the global SpinNetwork object created by the script tag
   - Added basic error handling to gracefully report when the library isn't loaded

The changes have resolved two of the four major issues (script loading and routing problems) and made significant progress on a third (module import issues). The remaining focus is on fixing the Markdown header ID anchors and completing the module loading strategy for all documentation pages.

Next steps will focus on addressing the Markdown rendering issues and bundling the required UMD libraries to the correct locations.

### T32: Fix Library Build Errors
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** 2025-04-20
**Last Active:** 2025-04-20 22:30 IST
**Completed:** 2025-04-20 22:30 IST
**Dependencies:** -

#### Context
Fixing TypeScript build errors in the library bundling process, specifically focusing on interface and type export issues that were preventing successful compilation of the library.

#### Critical Files
- `/lib/core/index.ts` - Modified to fix interface export syntax
- `/lib/core/intertwinerSpace.ts` - Contains the interface definition
- `/memory-bank/errorLog.md` - Updated with error details and solution
- `/memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated with new task

#### Implementation Progress
1. ✅ Identified the build error during `pnpm run build:lib`
2. ✅ Located the source of the error in export syntax for `IntertwinerBasisState` interface
3. ✅ Analyzed how the TypeScript/Vite bundler handles interface exports
4. ✅ Modified export statement to use separate `export type` for interfaces
5. ✅ Verified the fix by successfully building the library
6. ✅ Documented the solution in errorLog.md
7. ✅ Updated tasks.md with the new task and implementation details

#### Working State
Successfully fixed the TypeScript build error by modifying how interface types are exported:

1. **Original Issue**:
   ```
   lib/core/index.ts (24:2): \"IntertwinerBasisState\" is not exported by \"lib/core/intertwinerSpace.ts\", imported by \"lib/core/index.ts\".
   ```

2. **Root Cause**:
   - The interface was correctly defined and exported in `intertwinerSpace.ts`
   - However, the bundler had issues with how it was imported/re-exported in `index.ts`
   - This is a common issue with TypeScript interfaces during bundling

3. **Solution**:
   - Modified the export statement to separate type exports from value exports
   - Changed from combined export to explicit `export type` syntax:
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   export {
     triangleInequality,
     allowedIntermediateSpins,
     intertwinerDimension,
     getIntertwinerBasis,
     getOptimizedIntertwinerBasis,
     IntertwinerBasisState
   } from './intertwinerSpace';
   
   // After:
   export {
     triangleInequality,
     allowedIntermediateSpins,
     intertwinerDimension,
     getIntertwinerBasis,
     getOptimizedIntertwinerBasis,
   } from './intertwinerSpace';
   export type { IntertwinerBasisState } from './intertwinerSpace';
   ```

The explicit separation of type exports from value exports resolves the issue by providing clearer instructions to the TypeScript compiler and bundler about how to handle the interface during the build process.
