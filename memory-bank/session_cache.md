## Status
CONTINUING

## Current Task
Fixing build errors in the simulation component and preparing for UI integration

## Current Step
Fixed TypeScript errors in simulation component files. Next steps will focus on UI integration.

## Critical Files
- `/src/simulation/core/types.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/stateVector.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/graph.ts`
- `/src/simulation/core/mathAdapter.ts`
- `/src/simulation/models/diffusionModels.ts`
- `/src/hooks/useSimulation.ts`
- `/src/components/panels/SimulationControlPanel.tsx`
- `/src/simulation/analysis/conservation.ts`
- `/src/simulation/analysis/geometricProps.ts`
- `/src/simulation/index.ts`
- `/memory-bank/errorLog.md`

## State Information
- Fixed interface definitions in types.ts by removing 'static' modifiers
- Implemented missing methods in graph.ts and stateVector.ts classes
- Fixed matrix/array conversion issues in mathAdapter.ts and diffusionModels.ts
- Simplified method signatures in analysis components
- Added proper eigendecomposition handling for matrix operations
- Fixed parameter types in useSimulation.ts and SimulationControlPanel.tsx
- Updated simulation exports and implementation in index.ts
- Added detailed error documentation in errorLog.md
- Successfully built the project after fixing all TypeScript errors
- Next steps will focus on creating UI components for simulation control and visualization

## Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Created directory structure for simulation component
2. âœ… Implemented core interfaces in types.ts
3. âœ… Created simulation-plan.md with revised approach leveraging existing libraries
4. âœ… Implemented math.js adapter for matrix operations
5. âœ… Built state vector implementation for simulation state
6. âœ… Implemented graph model for network representation
7. âœ… Created weight function factory for different edge weight calculations
8. âœ… Implemented diffusion models (ordinary and telegraph)
9. âœ… Created time evolution engine
10. âœ… Implemented numerical solvers (Euler, Midpoint, RK4, Adaptive RKF45)
11. âœ… Created visualization adapter for Cytoscape.js
12. âœ… Implemented analysis tools (geometric properties, conservation laws, statistics)
13. âœ… Fixed all TypeScript errors in simulation component
14. ðŸ”„ Prepare UI integration components
15. â¬œ Implement simulation control panel UI
16. â¬œ Create visualization integration with Cytoscape.js
17. â¬œ Implement parameter adjustment UI
18. â¬œ Add analysis and results visualization panels

## Fixed Errors
1. âœ… Removed 'static' modifiers from interface methods in types.ts
2. âœ… Implemented missing methods in SpinNetworkGraph and SimulationStateVector classes
3. âœ… Fixed matrix-to-array conversion issues with proper error handling
4. âœ… Addressed unused variable warnings across multiple files
5. âœ… Fixed eigendecomposition handling in mathAdapter.ts
6. âœ… Updated parameter definition in useSimulation.ts to match interface
7. âœ… Added type casting for dropdown options in SimulationControlPanel.tsx
8. âœ… Updated index.ts to properly implement and export SimulationEngine
9. âœ… Simplified method signatures in analysis components by removing unused parameters
10. âœ… Fixed type conversions between math.js objects and native arrays

## Design Decisions
- Using math.js for matrix operations and numerical methods
- Creating visualization-agnostic models to support both Cytoscape.js and future three.js
- Implementing immutable data structures for state safety
- Supporting both 2D and 3D network representations with a common interface
- Designing with future extensibility for different diffusion models
- Implementing multiple numerical solvers with different accuracy/performance tradeoffs
- Providing comprehensive analysis tools for geometric properties and conservation laws
- Creating a clear separation between simulation logic and visualization
- Using factory patterns for creating model instances (solvers, diffusion models, etc.)
- Keeping core state immutable for better predictability and debugging
- Using adapter pattern for visualization integration to allow future visualization methods

## Notes
- All TypeScript build errors have been resolved, and the application builds successfully
- The matrix conversion issues were primarily due to type incompatibilities between math.js and TypeScript
- Fixed interface methods needed to be changed from 'static' to instance methods
- The simulation component is now ready for UI integration
- Next session will focus on creating simulation control panel components
- Fixed issues documented in errorLog.md for future reference
