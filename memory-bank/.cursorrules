# Spin Network Visualization App Development Rules

## Project Architecture

1. This is a React application using TypeScript and built with Vite
2. The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling
3. Dependencies are managed with pnpm (not npm or yarn)
4. The app has a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
5. Components are organized by functionality (layouts, tools, panels, visualization)

## Data Model Patterns

1. The network data model uses TypeScript interfaces for all elements
2. Network operations return new objects rather than modifying existing ones (immutability)
3. Node IDs are unique strings with format 'node-{timestamp}-{random}'
4. Edge IDs are unique strings with format 'edge-{timestamp}-{random}'
5. All operations include validation to ensure network integrity
6. Edges can have null source/target to support "dangling" edges
7. Dangling edges store position information for their unconnected endpoints
8. Placeholder nodes are created for visualization of dangling edge endpoints
9. Node and edge types have unique string IDs for reference in the data model
10. Type IDs with pattern 'node-type-{timestamp}' and 'edge-type-{timestamp}'
11. Built-in system types ('regular', 'placeholder', 'dangling') have special handling

## Interface Patterns

1. The application uses a resizable panel system for flexible workspace customization
2. The main layout consists of:
   - Left panel for network tools
   - Center area for network visualization (containing toolbar with undo/redo, mode buttons, and zoom controls)
   - Right panel for properties and simulation controls
   - Bottom panel for energy/metrics visualization
3. Resize handles allow users to adjust panel sizes to their preference
4. Panels maintain minimum and maximum size constraints
5. All panels must have proper vertical scrolling with overflow-y-auto
6. Interaction modes (select, pan, add node, add edge, delete) use visual feedback
7. Status indicators guide users through multi-step operations
8. Cursor styles change based on the current interaction mode
9. Timestamps are added to filenames when saving networks

## Network Visualization Patterns

1. Cytoscape.js is used for network visualization
2. Network elements (nodes/edges) are selectable for property editing
3. Nodes represent intertwiners with position and intertwiner value properties
4. Edges represent spins with source, target, and spin value properties
5. The visualization supports multiple modes (select, pan, add node, add edge, delete)
6. Exercise caution when using Cytoscape.js layout functions - they can cause rendering issues
7. Always use try/catch blocks around Cytoscape.js operations that might fail
8. Prefer CSS classes for styling Cytoscape elements over direct style application
9. Use appropriate selectors for filtering nodes by type (regular vs. placeholder)
10. Set fixed node dimensions to prevent automatic scaling
11. Use more padding when fitting elements to the view
12. Limit maximum zoom level to maintain visual consistency
13. Use the useNetworkStyles hook to apply view settings to Cytoscape
14. Update Cytoscape styles when view settings change using useEffect
15. Node and edge types define visual properties (color, size, shape, etc.)
16. The Type Management UI allows customization of element visual properties
17. Type-specific styles override global view settings when applied

## Event Handling Patterns

1. Use namespaced event handlers (e.g., 'tap.delete') for better event management
2. Remove existing handlers before adding new ones to prevent duplicates
3. Use `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` to control event bubbling
4. Handle events differently based on node type (regular vs. placeholder)
5. Reattach handlers after operations that modify the graph
6. Use filters like `cy.nodes().filter('[type != "placeholder"]')` to target specific node types
7. Separate handlers for different interaction modes
8. Centralize complex operations in helper functions (createEdge, createDanglingEdge, etc.)
9. Use saveHistoryBeforeGroupOperation and finalizeGroupOperation for composite operations
10. Ensure deletion handlers properly clean up related elements
11. Add detailed console logging for debugging complex event chains

## Placeholder Node Patterns

1. Placeholder nodes are used to visualize dangling edge endpoints
2. Placeholder nodes have a different visual style (diamond shape, orange color, dashed border)
3. Placeholder nodes store metadata about their associated edge
4. Placeholder nodes can be converted to real nodes in select mode
5. Clicking on a placeholder node in select mode prompts for conversion
6. Placeholder nodes can be used as connection points in edge creation mode
7. Deleting a placeholder also deletes its associated edge

## Component Patterns

1. ResizablePanel is a reusable component for creating panels that can be resized by the user
2. Network generators create different types of networks (lattice, circular, random)
3. Property panels show context-sensitive controls based on selected elements
4. Interface components use consistent styling from Tailwind CSS
5. Mode buttons use toggle behavior (active→inactive) for better UX
6. Confirmation dialogs are used for destructive operations
7. HeaderDropdown provides consistent dropdown functionality in the header
8. SettingsDropdown organizes application settings with submenus
9. Dropdown menus use a consistent back-button pattern for submenu navigation
10. Custom CSS classes (menu-item, menu-label) ensure consistent styling in dropdowns
11. Type management uses a tabbed modal interface for different element types
12. Type creation/editing forms provide live preview of appearance changes
13. Type managers handle CRUD operations for node/edge types

## Coding Conventions

1. Use functional components with hooks, not class components
2. Use TypeScript interfaces for component props and data structures
3. Maintain clear type definitions for all data structures
4. Place CSS in the appropriate style files, not inline (except for dynamic values)
5. Follow the existing naming conventions for files and components
6. Use consistent indentation (2 spaces) and formatting

## State Management

1. Using Redux with Redux Toolkit for state management
2. State updates are immutable (create new objects rather than modifying existing ones)
3. Use selector functions to extract data from state where appropriate
4. Action creators are strongly typed with PayloadAction<T>
5. All hooks must be called unconditionally at the top level of components
6. Use useMemo for conditional logic that depends on state
7. Keep Redux state normalized and minimal
8. Network operations are triggered through Redux actions
9. UI state (modes, selection) is managed through the uiSlice
10. Use the store.getState() method to access Redux state outside of components
11. History state is maintained alongside network state for undo/redo functionality
12. Group operations should be tracked as atomic units in history
13. Save and restore the entire history state when persisting networks
14. Theme settings are stored in Redux and applied using ThemeProvider
15. Visual settings (nodeSize, edgeThickness, labels) are persisted in Redux
16. Performance settings control rendering quality and animation smoothness

## Theme Management

1. The application supports light, dark, and system themes
2. ThemeProvider applies the current theme based on Redux state
3. Dark mode uses CSS class 'dark-mode' applied to the document root
4. Theme colors are defined using CSS variables for consistent styling
5. All color values should use the CSS variables rather than hardcoded values
6. System theme detection uses window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')
7. Dropdown menus and UI components should have proper dark mode styling

## Development Workflow

1. Understand existing code before making changes
2. Make incremental changes that can be easily tested
3. Consider how new features will integrate with the existing architecture
4. Maintain documentation in the memory-bank alongside code changes
5. Test UI changes across different panel configurations
6. Check different interaction modes when implementing new features
7. Consider edge cases for user interactions
