## Overview
This index provides a hierarchical view of the [MODULE_NAME] components, ordered by their dependencies. Components at each level may depend on components from previous levels but not on components from later levels.

## Level 0: Core Types and Interfaces
Location: `src/core/types.ts`

[List core types and interfaces with their methods]

## Level 1: Utilities and Basic Operations
Location: `src/utils/`

### [Utility Module 1] (`filename.ts`)
[Description]

**Types:**
- Type definitions

**Core Functions:**
- Function listings with signatures and brief descriptions

**Validation Functions:** (if applicable)
- Validation function listings

**Utility Functions:**
- Utility function listings

## Level 2: [Main Functionality Classes]
Location: `src/[directory]/`

### [Component 1] (`filename.ts`)
[Description]

**Main Class: `[ClassName] implements [Interface]`**

**Core Methods:**
- Method listings with signatures

**Static Factory Methods:**
- Factory method listings

**Features:**
- Key features and capabilities
