# Task Context: T35 - Enhance Node and Edge Data Structures for Intertwiners

*Last Updated: April 21, 2025 (23:55 IST)*

## Task Details
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Started:** April 21, 2025
**Last Active:** April 21, 2025 (23:55 IST)
**Dependencies:** T20
**Parent Task:** None
**Location in tasks.md:** Active Tasks section

## Context
This task focuses on enhancing the data structures for nodes and edges in the spin network to better represent the physics concepts, particularly improving the intertwiner representation to support intertwiner spaces with multiple dimensions and basis states. Based on the insights from `mathematical-roadmap.md` and `intertwiner-spaces.md`, we need to update the network model to capture the full complexity of intertwiner spaces, including proper tensor representation.

The current implementation represents intertwiners as simple numerical values, which doesn't capture the full complexity of the physics model. This enhancement will modify the data structure to better represent intertwiner spaces with their dimensions and basis states, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code. The changes will lay the groundwork for more accurate physical simulations and visualizations of spin networks.

## Working State
Successfully implemented the enhanced node and edge data structures and created a comprehensive plan for tensor representation:

1. **Data Structure Implementation**:
   - Added `IntertwinerData` interface to store rich information about intertwiner spaces
   - Defined initial structure as:
   ```typescript
   interface IntertwinerData {
     value: number; // For backward compatibility
     dimension?: number; // Dimension of the intertwiner space
     basisState?: number; // Index of the basis state (when dimension > 1)
     recouplingScheme?: string; // Specification of the recoupling scheme used
     tensorRepresentation?: IntertwinerTensorData; // Full tensor representation
   }
   ```
   - Drafted `IntertwinerTensorData` interface for sparse tensor representation with complex elements
   - Implemented backward compatibility checks to handle both numeric and object-based intertwiner values

2. **Enhanced Functionality**:
   - Added draft implementation of `getIntertwinerValue()` helper function to consistently access intertwiner values
   - Sketched `getIntertwinerDimension()` function to calculate/retrieve dimensions
   - Created draft enhancement for `addNode()` to properly initialize default values for new nodes
   - Worked on update to `updateNode()` with special handling for merging intertwiner objects

3. **Tensor Implementation Plan**:
   - Created comprehensive plan in `tensor-plan.md` outlining all aspects of implementation
   - Designed sparse tensor representation for efficient storage of intertwiner tensors
   - Planned utility functions for tensor creation, element access, and contraction
   - Included factory functions for generating standard intertwiners (3j, 4j symbols)
   - Designed quantum state calculation functions for computing graph state amplitudes
   - Planned tensor visualization components for interactive exploration

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while creating a path to significantly enhance the physics representation capabilities. The next step is to complete the tensor data structure interfaces (T35.1) and then move on to implementing the utility functions (T35.2).

## Challenges and Solutions
1. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Challenge: Need to support both numeric intertwiner values and the new rich object format
   - Solution: Design all functions to check type and handle both formats, with a helper function to extract values consistently

2. **Sparse Tensor Representation**:
   - Challenge: Full tensor representation would be inefficient for higher dimensions
   - Solution: Implementing a sparse representation that only stores non-zero elements with their indices

3. **Complex Numbers**:
   - Challenge: JavaScript doesn't have native complex number support
   - Solution: Implementing a simple Complex class to handle complex arithmetic needed for quantum calculations

4. **Recoupling Scheme Dependence**:
   - Challenge: Different recoupling schemes can yield different intertwiner dimensions for the same spins
   - Solution: Explicitly store the recoupling scheme with the intertwiner data and ensure consistency in calculations

## Related Tasks
- T20: Add Intertwiner Space Implementation - Prerequisite that provides the mathematical foundation
- T34: Complete Simulation Engine Migration to Standalone Library - Will need to incorporate these enhanced data structures

## Notes
The work on this task has highlighted how important it is to properly represent the quantum geometric structures of spin networks. By enhancing the data model to support proper tensor representation of intertwiners, we're laying the groundwork for more accurate physical simulations and setting up the application to handle more advanced quantum gravity calculations in the future.

Key decisions:
1. Use sparse representation for tensors to balance memory efficiency with computational convenience
2. Maintain backward compatibility while introducing enhanced functionality
3. Explicitly track recoupling schemes to ensure physical consistency
4. Add validation functions to verify that intertwiner values are consistent with adjacent edge spins
5. Design for future extensions to support higher-valent nodes beyond the 4-valent case
