## Session Notes
Today's focus has been on enhancing the node and edge data structures for better representation of intertwiner spaces in the spin network. This builds upon the work done in T20 (Intertwiner Space Implementation) and connects with the broader simulation library migration effort (T34). The primary goal is to update the data model to support richer physics representations while maintaining backward compatibility.

Key insights from today's work:
1. The current numerical representation of intertwiners is inadequate for capturing the full complexity of intertwiner spaces
2. The enhanced data structure needs to support tensor representations while maintaining backward compatibility
3. This enhancement is a prerequisite for implementing proper quantum state calculations in future work
