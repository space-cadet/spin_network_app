# Subtask Context: T35.1 - Create Tensor Data Structure Interfaces

*Last Updated: April 21, 2025 (23:30 IST)*

## Subtask Details
**Parent Task:** T35 - Enhance Node and Edge Data Structures for Intertwiners
**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Priority:** HIGH
**Started:** April 21, 2025
**Last Active:** April 21, 2025 (23:30 IST)

## Context
This subtask focuses on defining comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for representing intertwiner tensors in the spin network model. These interfaces need to support efficient storage of potentially large tensors while maintaining type safety and ease of use. The interfaces will be used throughout the application to represent the quantum states of intertwiners at nodes in the spin network.

Based on the tensor implementation plan in `tensor-plan.md`, we need to create interfaces that support:
1. Complex number representation (for quantum amplitudes)
2. Sparse tensor representation (for efficient storage)
3. Tensor indices with arbitrary dimension
4. Operations like tensor contraction and product

## Critical Files
- `src/models/types.ts`: Will contain the new interface definitions
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/tensor-plan.md`: Contains the implementation plan
- `src/utils/mathTypes.ts`: May need to be created for math-specific type definitions like Complex

## Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Create draft implementation plan for tensor interfaces
2. âœ… Define Complex number interface
3. ðŸ”„ Define SparseIntertwinerElement interface
4. ðŸ”„ Define IntertwinerTensorData interface
5. â¬œ Add type helpers for tensor operations
6. â¬œ Add TypeScript documentation for all interfaces
7. â¬œ Validate interface designs with practical examples

## Working State
Currently working on defining the core interfaces for tensor representation. Initial drafts of the interfaces look like:

```typescript
// Complex number representation
interface Complex {
  re: number; // Real part
  im: number; // Imaginary part
}

// Element in a sparse tensor representation
interface SparseIntertwinerElement {
  indices: number[]; // Multi-dimensional indices
  value: Complex;    // Complex value at these indices
}

// Full tensor representation
interface IntertwinerTensorData {
  dimensions: number[];               // Dimensions of the tensor
  elements: SparseIntertwinerElement[]; // Non-zero elements
  metadata?: {                        // Optional metadata
    recouplingScheme?: string;        // Recoupling scheme information
    spinLabels?: number[];            // Spin labels for tensor indices
    basisName?: string;               // Name of the basis used
  };
}
```

These interfaces will allow for efficient storage and manipulation of tensor data, which is essential for representing quantum states in spin networks. The sparse representation is crucial because many intertwiner tensors in physics are sparse (mostly zeros), especially in higher dimensions.

The next step is to complete the interface definitions with proper documentation and add type helpers for common tensor operations.

## Relationship to Parent Task
This subtask is the foundational work for T35 (Enhance Node and Edge Data Structures for Intertwiners). The interfaces defined here will be used in all subsequent subtasks, particularly:
- T35.2 will implement utility functions using these interfaces
- T35.3 will update the network model to use these interfaces

By creating clean, well-documented interfaces first, we ensure that the rest of the implementation will be built on a solid foundation with proper type safety.

## Notes
Key considerations for the interface design:
1. **Performance**: Using sparse representation to balance memory efficiency with computational needs
2. **Type Safety**: Ensuring proper TypeScript typing for all operations
3. **Extensibility**: Designing interfaces that can accommodate future extensions
4. **Usability**: Making the interfaces intuitive for developers without extensive physics background
5. **Mathematical Consistency**: Ensuring the interfaces support proper quantum mechanical operations

One open question is whether to include methods in the interfaces or keep them as pure data structures and implement operations as separate functions. The current approach leans toward pure data structures with separate utility functions for better testability and composition.
