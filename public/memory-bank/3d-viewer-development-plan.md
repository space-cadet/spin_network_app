# 3D Network Viewer Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for implementing a 3D network visualization capability for non-planar graphs in the Spin Network Visualization and Diffusion App. The plan addresses the technical approach, architecture, implementation phases, and risk assessment.

## Goals and Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. Enable visualization of non-planar graphs in 3D space
2. Provide intuitive navigation controls for 3D exploration
3. Support seamless switching between 2D and 3D views
4. Maintain consistent network operations across view modes
5. Optimize performance for complex network structures

### User Requirements
1. View complex spin networks that cannot be properly visualized in 2D
2. Interact with network elements in 3D space (select, create, modify)
3. Apply different 3D layout algorithms for optimal visualization
4. Navigate 3D space with intuitive camera controls
5. Maintain context when switching between 2D and 3D representations

## Technical Approach

### Technology Stack Extension

The 3D visualization will extend the current stack with:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| 3D Rendering | Three.js | WebGL-based 3D rendering |
| React Integration | react-three-fiber | React wrapper for Three.js |
| Controls & Helpers | drei | Common Three.js components and utilities |
| Layout Algorithms | Custom implementation | 3D force-directed and other layouts |

### Architecture Design

The 3D viewer will integrate with the existing architecture following these patterns:

1. **Component Structure**:
   ```
   NetworkViewer (Container)
   ├── ViewSelector (2D/3D toggle)
   ├── CytoscapeViewer (2D View)
   └── ThreeNetworkViewer (3D View)
       ├── Scene
       ├── Camera & Controls
       ├── Nodes
       ├── Edges
       └── Visual Helpers
   ```

2. **State Management Extension**:
   - Add view mode to Redux state (2D/3D/2.5D)
   - Add 3D camera state (position, target, zoom)
   - Add 3D layout settings to state
   - Track 3D-specific visual settings

3. **Data Flow**:
   ```
   Network Data Model ─→ Visualization Adapter ─→ Renderer (2D or 3D)
          ↑                                              |
          └──────────────── User Interaction ────────────┘
   ```

4. **View Switching Mechanism**:
   - Maintain element selection across view changes
   - Preserve camera/viewport position relationships
   - Animate transitions between views for context preservation

    target: { x: number, y: number, z: number };
    zoom: number;
  };
  layout3D: {

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

1. **Performance with Large Networks**:
   - Risk: 3D rendering could significantly impact performance with large networks
   - Mitigation: Implement level-of-detail, frustum culling, and optimized rendering techniques
   - Fallback: Provide simplified view options for very large networks

2. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Risk: WebGL support and performance varies across browsers
   - Mitigation: Target WebGL 1.0 features for maximum compatibility
   - Fallback: Detect capabilities and provide appropriate feedback

3. **Integration Complexity**:
   - Risk: Maintaining consistent behavior between 2D and 3D views could be challenging
   - Mitigation: Create comprehensive adapter layer and thorough testing
   - Fallback: Independent operation modes if full consistency not achievable

### User Experience Risks

1. **Learning Curve for 3D Navigation**:
   - Risk: Users may find 3D navigation challenging or disorienting
   - Mitigation: Implement intuitive controls and provide tooltips/guidance
   - Fallback: Add preset views and simplified navigation options

2. **Information Clarity**:
   - Risk: 3D visualization could make network structure less clear in some cases
   - Mitigation: Provide strong visual cues and optional simplification
   - Fallback: Easy switching to 2D for clarity when needed

## Evaluation Criteria

The success of the 3D network viewer implementation will be measured by:

1. **Functionality**: Can users effectively visualize and interact with non-planar graphs?
2. **Performance**: Does the 3D viewer maintain acceptable performance with typical network sizes?
