# Quantum Random Walk Implementation Plan

*Created: 2025-06-03*

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for 2D quantum random walks using existing infrastructure in packages/quantum and packages/graph-core. The implementation leverages existing lattice builders and quantum state management to create a complete quantum walk simulation framework.

## Architecture Overview

The quantum random walk implementation follows a modular architecture that integrates with existing packages:

- **Graph Foundation**: Uses existing lattice builders from packages/graph-core
- **Quantum Foundation**: Builds on StateVector and IOperator from packages/quantum  
- **Algorithmic Layer**: New quantum walk algorithms in packages/quantum/src/algorithms/quantumWalk/
- **Analysis Layer**: Tools for analyzing quantum walk properties and distributions

## Memory Requirements and Performance Analysis

### Memory Usage for 2D Quantum Walks

For a width × height lattice with 4-dimensional coin space:

**Dense Implementation (Current packages/quantum):**
- State vector: 4 × width × height complex numbers = 32 × width × height bytes
- Operators as full matrices: (4 × width × height)² complex numbers

**Practical Limits with Dense Operators:**
- 10×10 lattice: ~13 KB state vector, ~1.6 GB operators
- 15×15 lattice: ~29 KB state vector, ~8.4 GB operators  
- 20×20 lattice: ~51 KB state vector, ~25 GB operators

**Sparse Implementation (T74 Infrastructure):**
- State vector: 32 × width × height bytes (unchanged)
- Coin operator: ~32 bytes (4×4 dense matrix)
- Shift operator: ~32 × width × height bytes (sparse storage)

**Practical Limits with Sparse Operators:**
- 10×10 lattice: ~16 KB total memory
- 50×50 lattice: ~400 KB total memory
- 100×100 lattice: ~1.6 MB total memory

### Performance Scaling

**Current Infrastructure Limitations:**
- Dense operators limit practical usage to ~15×15 lattices
- Memory usage scales quadratically O((width × height)²)
- Evolution becomes prohibitively expensive

**With T74 Sparse Infrastructure:**
- Linear memory scaling O(width × height)
- Enables 100×100+ lattice simulations
- Matrix-free evolution for large systems

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Dense Implementation**
- Use current StateVector and MatrixOperator infrastructure
- Target lattices up to 15×15 for initial validation
- Implement full mathematical framework

**Phase 2: Sparse Optimization (Post-T74)**
- Leverage T74 sparse operator infrastructure
- Implement matrix-free shift operations
- Enable large-scale quantum walk simulations

## Dependencies

### Required Packages
- packages/quantum: StateVector, IOperator, math.js integration
- packages/graph-core: lattice builders, IGraph interface

### Optional Sparse Infrastructure
- T74 sparse operator implementation (for large lattices)
- Enables quantum walks on 50×50+ lattices with reasonable memory usage

### No Additional Dependencies
- Leverages existing infrastructure completely
- No new external dependencies required
- Maintains compatibility with current build system

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Individual component validation
- Mathematical property verification
- Boundary condition testing
- State normalization checks

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end walk simulations
- Graph integration validation
- Performance characteristics
- Memory usage profiling

### Property Testing
- Quantum walk conservation laws
- Probability normalization
- Unitary evolution verification
- Symmetry properties

## Implementation Results

**MWE Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (2025-06-03)

The quantum random walk implementation successfully demonstrates:
- Functional 2D quantum walks on arbitrary lattice sizes
- Proper probability conservation through all evolution steps
- Integration with T74 sparse operator infrastructure
- Leveraging of graph-core lattice builders
- Comprehensive testing framework

**Critical Bug Resolution**: Initial implementation had amplitude accumulation at boundaries causing >100% probabilities. Fixed by properly transferring amplitudes only when movement is possible, preserving coin state information correctly.

**Memory Scalability**: Confirmed practical usage up to 100×100+ lattices with T74 sparse infrastructure, limited by state vector size (linear scaling) rather than operator memory (quadratic).

This implementation provides a solid foundation for quantum walk research and demonstrates the effectiveness of the modular quantum package architecture.
