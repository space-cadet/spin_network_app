# Spin Network Simulation Component Implementation Plan

*Created: April 10, 2025*

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the spin network simulation component, considering the need for compatibility with both current Cytoscape.js visualization and future three.js 3D visualization.

## Core Architecture

We will implement a modular, abstracted architecture that:

1. Separates the simulation logic from visualization concerns
2. Uses existing libraries for mathematical operations where appropriate
3. Provides clear interfaces between components
4. Remains visualization-agnostic to support both 2D and future 3D implementations

## Library Usage

We will leverage the following existing libraries:

1. **math.js** - For matrix operations, numerical methods, and differential equation solving
2. **d3** - For data transformation and potentially force-directed layouts
3. **Cytoscape.js** - For current 2D visualization (but not as our core data model)

## Key Components

### 1. Graph Model

- Create a custom graph model implementation that is not tied to any visualization library
- Design interfaces that can easily map to/from both Cytoscape.js and future three.js implementations
- Implement quantum gravity specific functionality (spin networks, intertwiner values)

### 2. Mathematical Engine

- Use math.js for matrix operations, eigenvalue calculations, and numerical integration
- Implement specialized quantum geometric calculations on top of math.js
- Create adapters to bridge between our graph model and math.js matrix operations

### 3. Diffusion Models

- Implement both ordinary diffusion and telegraph equation models
- Use math.js for numerical integration (euler, rk4, etc.)
- Create a plugin system for different weight functions

### 4. Visualization Adapters

- Create adapters to convert simulation state to current Cytoscape.js visualization
- Design with future three.js adapter in mind
- Use a common interface for both 2D and 3D visualization adapters

### 5. Time Evolution Engine

- Implement step-based time evolution with configurable time steps
- Support both real-time and step-by-step simulation modes
- Include history tracking for playback and analysis

### 6. Geometric Analysis

- Add utilities for calculating geometric properties of the network
- Implement visualization-agnostic metrics and properties
- Create exportable results for external analysis

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Define all key interfaces
2. Implement basic graph model
3. Create math.js adapters for matrix operations
4. Implement Laplacian generation with configurable weight functions

### Phase 2: Simulation Engine

1. Implement state vector representation
2. Create ordinary diffusion equation solver
3. Add basic time evolution with Euler integration
4. Implement visualization adapter for Cytoscape.js

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. Add telegraph equation solver
2. Implement RK4 and adaptive integration methods
3. Create comprehensive geometric analysis tools
4. Add support for state matrices and correlation tracking

### Phase 4: 3D Support

1. Prepare interfaces for three.js integration
2. Ensure all algorithms support 3D network structures
3. Create 3D-specific data structures if needed
4. Test with simple 3D network layouts

## Design Principles

1. **Decoupling** - Separate simulation logic from visualization
2. **Library Independence** - Don't depend on any specific visualization library
3. **Domain Specificity** - Focus on quantum geometric aspects
4. **Performance** - Optimize for larger networks and complex simulations
5. **Extensibility** - Make it easy to add new models and algorithms
6. **3D Readiness** - Ensure all algorithms and data structures can support 3D

## Next Steps

1. Create the core interfaces and types
2. Implement the graph model with math.js integration
3. Build basic diffusion model with time evolution
4. Create the Cytoscape.js adapter
5. Test with simple network configurations
